Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2007;Oct Nov;Are two atoms of the same element identical?;No. Two atoms of the same chemical element are typically not identical. First of all, there is a range of possible states that the electrons of an atom can occupy. Two atoms of the same element can be different if their electrons are in different states. If one copper atom has an electron in an excited state and another copper atom has all of its electrons in the ground state, then the two atoms are different. The excited copper atom will emit a bit of light when the electron relaxes back down to the ground state, and the copper atom already in the ground state will not.;"Since the states of the electrons in an atom are what determine the nature of the chemical bonding that the atom experiences, two atoms of the same element can react differently if they are in different states. For instance, a neutral sodium atom (say, from a chunk of sodium metal) reacts with water much more violently than an ionized sodium atom (say, from a bit of salt). Chemists know this very well. It's not enough to say what atoms are involved if you want to fully describe and predict a reaction. You have to also specify the ionization/excitation states of the electrons in the atoms. Even if left alone, an atom often does not come with an equal number of protons and electrons.

But what if two atoms of the same element both have their electrons in the same states. Then are they identical? No, they are still not identical. Two atoms of the same element and in the same electronic state could be traveling or rotating at different speeds, which affects their ability to chemically bond. Slower moving atoms (such as the atoms in solid iron) have time to form stable bonds, while faster moving atoms (such as the atoms in liquid iron) cannot form such stable bonds. A slow moving tin atom acts differently from a rapidly moving tin atom.

But what if two atoms of the same element both have their electrons in the same states, and the atoms are both traveling and rotating at the same speed. Then are they identical? No. Although two such atoms are essentially chemically identical (they will chemically react in the same way), they are not completely identical. There's more to the atom than the electrons. There's also the nucleus. The nucleus of an atom contains neutrons and protons bonded tightly together. The same chemical element can have a different number of neutrons and still be the same element. We refer to the atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons as ""isotopes"". While the particular isotope involved does not affect how an atom will react chemically, it does determine how the atom will behave in nuclear reactions. The most common nuclear reaction on earth is radioactive decay. Some isotopes decay very quickly into other elements and emit radiation, while other isotopes do not. If you are doing carbon dating, the fact that a carbon-12 atom is not identical to a carbon-14 atom is essential to the dating process. Simply counting the number of carbon atoms in a sample will not give you any information about the age of a sample. You will have to count the number of different isotopes of carbon instead.";"But what if two atoms are the same element, have electrons in the same state, are traveling and rotating at the same speed, and have the same number of neutrons; then are they identical? No. Just like the electrons, the neutrons and protons in the nucleus can be in various excited states. In addition, the nucleus as a whole can rotate and vibrate at various speeds. Therefore, even if all else is identical, two gold atoms can have their nuclei in different excited states and behave differently in nuclear reactions.

To state the case succinctly, it is very hard to have two atoms of the same element be exactly identical. In fact, succeeding in coaxing a group of atoms to be very close to identical was worthy of a Nobel Prize. With that said, don't think that atoms have individual identities beyond what has been mentioned here. If two carbon atoms are in the exact same molecular, atomic, electronic and nuclear states, then those two carbon atoms are identical, no matter where they came from or what has happened to them in the past.";pay,product,clean,honor,sick
Edexcel;O;2210 - Computer Science;2016;Oct Nov;Can water stay liquid below zero degrees Celsius?;"Yes, water can stay liquid below zero degrees Celsius. There are a few ways in which this can happen.

First of all, the phase of a material (whether it is gas, liquid, or solid) depends strongly on both its temperature and pressure. For most liquids, applying pressure raises the temperature at which the liquid freezes to solid. A solid is formed when the loose, meandering molecules of a liquid get slow enough and close enough to form stable bonds that pin them in place. When we apply pressure to a liquid, we force the molecules to get closer together. They can therefore form stable bonds and become a solid even if they have a higher temperature than the freezing point at standard pressure.";"Water is somewhat unique, though. Water molecules spread out when they are bonding into a solid crystalline structure. This spreading-out action leads ice to be less dense than liquid water, causing ice to float. This spreading-out action of the water molecules during freezing also means that applying pressure to water lowers the freezing point. If you apply enough pressure (making it hard for the water molecules to spread out into the solid structure), you can have liquid water several degrees below zero degrees Celsius.

Even if you don't apply pressure, you can still have liquid water at sub-zero temperatures using additives. Additives such as salt can interfere with the chemical bonding needed to form a solid and they therefore can lower water's freezing point. Salt is composed of strong sodium and chlorine ions. When dissolved in water, the water molecules tend to stick to the salt ions instead of to each other, and they therefore don't freeze as readily. As you add more salt to water, its freezing point continues to drop until the water reaches saturation and cannot hold any more salt. If you add enough salt, the freezing point of water can be dropped as low as -21 degrees Celsius. This fact means that water at -21 degrees Celsius can still remain liquid if enough salt is added. Instead of keeping liquid water from freezing, this powerful property of salt can also be used to turn ice back into water. Sprinkling salt on icy sidewalks lowers the freezing point of the ice below the ambient temperature and the ice melts. But sprinkling salt on icy walkways won't help if the ambient temperature is below -21 degrees Celsius. The effect of salt on water's freezing point also has profound effects on earth's oceans.";"Even if you don't apply pressure and don't add anything to the water, you can still have liquid water at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. In order for water to freeze to ice, it needs something to freeze onto to start the process. We call these starting points ""nucleation centers"". In most situations, a little bit of dust, impurity, or even little vibrations in the water provide nucleation centers for the water to freeze onto. But if your water is very pure and very still, there is nothing for the water molecules to crystallize onto. As a result, you can cool very pure water well below zero degrees Celsius without it freezing. Water in this condition is called ""supercooled"". At standard pressure, pure water can be supercooled to as low as about -40 degrees Celsius. Supercooled water is kept from freezing only by the lack of nucleation centers. Therefore, once nucleation centers are provided (which could be as simple as a vibration), the supercooled water quickly freezes. Freezing rain is a natural example of supercooled liquid water. Once freezing rain hits an object on earth's surface, that object provides nucleation centers, and the rain freezes to ice.";bend,rest,large,feel,roll
Edexcel;AS;2281 - Economics,;2021;May Jun;Can you light diamond on fire?;Yes, diamond can be burned. The most common form of burning in everyday life is carbon combustion. In carbon combustion, carbon atoms break their bonds with each other and with other atoms (which requires energy) to form bonds with oxygen atoms (which releases even more energy than first required).;"The net extra energy released in this reaction can then go on to rip more carbon atoms free of their non-oxygen neighbors, thus continuing the reaction, or the energy can escape as heat and light. Carbon bonded with oxygen makes carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, which are the waste products of combustion. They drift away from the fire as gases. Since biological organisms, and the fuels derived from biological organisms, contain a lot of carbon, much of the burning that goes on around us is carbon combustion. This includes camp fires, candles, car engines, and gas stoves. Pure diamond consists only of carbon atoms bonded into a dense, strong crystal lattice, so diamond can also undergo carbon combustion. In fact, Antoine Lavoisier first determined that diamond is made out of carbon by burning it and showing that the combustion product was carbon dioxide. The book Diamond Films and Coatings by Robert Foster Davis states, ""In 1772 the French chemist Antoine L. Lavoisier found that the products of diamond combustion behaved as, and most assuredly were, solely carbon dioxide... He determined that the ignition and burning of each produced equal amounts of â€˜bound air'.""";The presence of strong atomic bonds in diamond means that it takes a lot of energy to rip apart the carbon atoms in diamond in order to free them up to burn with oxygen. As a result, it takes a higher temperature to burn diamond than to burn wood. The ignition temperature of wood is about 300 degrees C while the ignition temperature of diamond in air is about 900 degrees C. Although diamond requires a higher temperature to burn, it does indeed burn via normal carbon combustion. You can even burn diamond in a regular flame if you are patient and conditions are right. To accelerate the burning of diamond, you can give it more heat and more oxygen. For instance, holding a blow torch to a diamond and then throwing it in a cup of liquid oxygen leads to an impressive display. Jewelers have to worry about this effect every day because they use flames to mold the metal in a diamond ring but don't want to burn the diamond.;not,congress,energy,friendly,properly
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2012;Jan Feb;How bad of an alcoholic do you have to be to have your brain affected?;One drink of alcohol is enough to affect your brain, whether you are an alcoholic or a casual social drinker. Alcohol is a psychoactive drug that interferes directly with the normal functioning of many parts of the brain. Fortunately, much of the effect caused by alcohol consumption can be repaired by the body when the person stops drinking. But ongoing alcohol consumption at heavy levels can cause damage so severe that the body cannot repair it and the damage becomes permanent. The National Institute of Health states,;"""Difficulty walking, blurred vision, slurred speech, slowed reaction times, impaired memory: Clearly, alcohol affects the brain. Some of these impairments are detectable after only one or two drinks and quickly resolve when drinking stops. On the other hand, a person who drinks heavily over a long period of time may have brain deficits that persist well after he or she achieves sobriety...Alcohol can produce detectable impairments in memory after only a few drinks and, as the amount of alcohol increases, so does the degree of impairment. Large quantities of alcohol, especially when consumed quickly and on an empty stomach, can produce a blackout, or an interval of time for which the intoxicated person cannot recall key details of events, or even entire events.""";Drinking alcohol (ethanol) is a two-carbon alcohol with the molecular formula CH3-CH2-OH. The hydroxyl group on the end (-OH) is able to participate in hydrogen bonding and accounts for much of its physical properties.;giving,bend,care,behavior,adventure
Cambridge;O;2210 - Computer Science;2012;Oct Nov;How can glass be a liquid if it's so hard?;"Glass is not a liquid in the strictest sense of the word. But it is also not a standard solid. The chemistry of glass is complex and research is ongoing, but the current consensus is that glass is a phase of matter all its own, known as an ""amorphous solid"".";"Scientists refer to any amorphous solid as a ""glass"". Glass transitions are highly complex and cannot be treated in the same way as traditional phase transitions, according to the textbook ""Glasses and the Glass Transition"" by Ivan S. Gutzow.";;knife,dropped,silly,toward,soon
Cambridge;O;2281 - Economics,;2014;Jan Feb;"How do I know if something is an acid so I can avoid eating it?
";"You eat acids all the time without knowing it and it's usually perfectly healthy. The danger is eating strong acids in high concentrations. The word ""acid"" describes a wide variety of substances that lie on a continuous spectrum of strength from essentially neutral to extremely acidic. As most chemistry textbooks note, we are surrounded by acids. Citric acid is what gives lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruits their zing.";"Phosphoric acid is used in colas. The building blocks of life; amino acids, fatty acids, DNA, and RNA; are all acids. Acid is one of the fundamental flavors our tongues can taste. We call it ""sour"" in everyday life. Anything that tastes sour â€“ from vinegar (acetic acid) to sour cream (lactic acid) â€“ has acid. Even strong acids can be safe in low concentrations. Hydrochloric acid is found naturally in the human stomach and is used to help digest food. The real danger to humans is when strong acids are found in high concentrations, such as the hydrochloric acid in toilet bowl cleaners or the sulfuric acid in car batteries.";Returning to the original question, how do you know if a substance is an acid with dangerously high concentration? There are all sorts of tests you could do, but it's better just to play it safe. Never eat an item unless you are sure it is food. Generally, it's not a good idea to eat household cleaners, disinfectants, antiseptics, rust removers, or battery juice, as these contain toxic chemicals such as acids in high concentration.;say,done,clothes,using,stand
Edexcel;AS;2281 - Economics,;2003;Aug Sep;"How do plants get their nitrogen from the air?
";Plants do not get their nitrogen directly from the air. Although nitrogen is the most abundant element in the air, every nitrogen atom in the air is triple-bonded to another nitrogen atom to form molecular nitrogen, N2. This triple bond is very strong and very hard to break (it takes energy to break chemical bonds whereas energy is only released when bonds are formed). As a result, even though nitrogen in the air is very common, it is energetically unfavorable for a plant to split the nitrogen molecule in order to get the raw atoms that it can use.;"The strong triple bond of N2 also makes it hard for molecular nitrogen to react with most other chemicals. This is, in fact, part of the reason there is so much nitrogen in the air to begin with. Also, the stability and symmetry of the nitrogen molecule makes it hard for different nitrogen molecules to bind to each other. This property means that molecular nitrogen can be cooled to very low temperatures before becoming liquid, leading liquid nitrogen to be a very effective cryogenic liquid.

The act of breaking apart the two atoms in a nitrogen molecule is called ""nitrogen fixation"". Plants get the nitrogen that they need from the soil, where it has already been fixed by bacteria and archaea. Bacteria and archaea in the soil and in the roots of some plants have the ability to convert molecular nitrogen from the air (N2) to ammonia (NH3), thereby breaking the tough triple bond of molecular nitrogen. Such organisms are called ""diazotrophs"". From here, various microorganisms convert ammonia to other nitrogen compounds that are easier for plants to use. In this way, plants get their nitrogen indirectly from the air via microorganisms in the soil and in certain plant roots. Note that lightning and high-energy solar radiation can also split the nitrogen molecule, and therefore also fixes the nitrogen in the air. However, the amount of nitrogen fixed by lightning and solar radiation is insignificant compared to the amount fixed by diazotrophs in the soil and in roots. In his book Nitrogen Fixation, John Postgate states,";"The fixation of nitrogen â€“ the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use â€“ is a process fundamental to world agriculture. It comes about as a consequence of spontaneous, anthropogenic and biological activities. The existence and importance of the biological component have been recognized for more than a century, but scientific advances over the past few decades have radically altered our understanding of its nature and mechanisms.

The biological nitrogen cycle crucially depends on soil-inhabiting and root-inhabiting bacteria and archaea, which split apart the nitrogen molecules from the air. Public Domain Image, source: EPA.";clean,liquid,glass,yard,deeply
Edexcel;AS;3204 - Bengali;2012;May Jun;How does dissolving a salt molecule in water make its atoms ionize?;"Dissolving a salt molecule in water does not make its atoms ionize. The atoms in solid salts are already ionized long before touching water.

Electrons in an atom can only take on specific wave states, and only one electron can occupy one wave state at a time. As a result, electrons in an atom take different states, starting from the lowest energy state and going upwards in energy until the electrons have all found distinct states. For various reasons that are not worth mentioning here, electron states in atoms tend to form various groups, with the states in the same group having very similar energies and states. Chemists call these groups of electron states ""shells"", even though they have nothing to do with literal shells.";"The interesting thing is that an atom with completely filled shells is very stable (all the available states in each group are occupied by electrons). On the other hand, an atom with its outermost shell only partially filled has a strong tendency to steal, lose, or share electrons from other atoms in order to fill its outermost shell and become stable. Such atoms are therefore chemically reactive. A well-known salt is sodium chloride (table salt), so let's use it as an example. A single neutral sodium atom has eleven electrons. Ten of these electrons fill states such that they form complete shells. The eleventh electron of sodium, however, is alone in the outermost, partially filled shell. Electrons are bound in atoms because their negative electric charge experiences electric attraction to the positive charge of the atom's nucleus. But for sodium, the negatively-charged electrons in the inner, completed shells do a good job of blocking, or screening, the attractive force of the nucleus on the eleventh electron. As a result, the eleventh electron of sodium is loosely bound to the atom and is ripe for being stolen by a more powerful atom.

In contrast, chlorine (17 electrons) has all of its shells filled with electrons except for its outermost shell which is one electron short of being complete. There is a very strong attraction by the chlorine atom on an outside electron which is needed to complete its shell. Sodium and chlorine are therefore a perfect match. Sodium has one electron it is not holding onto very strongly, and chlorine is looking for one more electron to steal to fill its shell. As a result, a pure sample of sodium reacts strongly with a pure sample of chlorine and the end product is table salt. Each chlorine atom steals an electron from the sodium atom. Each sodium atom now has 11 positive protons and 10 negative electrons, for a net charge of +1. Each chlorine atom now has 17 positive protons and 18 negative electrons for a net charge of -1. The atoms have therefore been ionized by the reaction that forms solid table salt, all without the presence of water. Both the sodium and the chlorine ions now have completely filled shells and are therefore stable. This is a good example of an atom that naturally has an unequal number of electron and protons.

The net positive sodium ion is now attracted to the net negative chlorine ion and this attraction forms what we call an ""ionic bond"". But, in reality, we don't have just one sodium ion sticking to ion chlorine ion. Instead, a lattice of many sodium ions ionically bonds to a lattice of chlorine ions, and we end up with a crystalline solid. Each sodium ion in the crystalline lattice of table salt is bound to the 6 nearest chlorine ions, and the same goes for each chlorine ion. The atoms in table salt are therefore already in the ionized state.";"Adding water does not ionize the atoms in salt, because they are already ionized. Instead, the water molecules stick to the already formed ions in the salt. The textbook titled Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments by Gerald Karp states, ""A crystal of table salt is held together by an electrostatic attraction between positively charged Na+ and negatively charged Clâ€“ ions. This type of attraction between fully charged components is called an ionic bond (or a salt bridge). Ionic bonds within a salt crystal may be quite strong. However, if a crystal of salt is dissolved in water, each of the individual ions becomes surrounded by water molecules, which inhibit oppositely charged ions from approaching one another closely enough to form ionic bonds."" Each water molecule has a permanent dipole, meaning that one end is always slightly positively charged and the other end is always slightly negatively charged. The charged ends of the water molecules are so strongly attracted to the charged ions in the salt crystal that the water destroys the solid lattice structure of the salt and each sodium and chlorine ion becomes surrounded by a layer of sticky water molecules. In chemistry, we say the salt has been dissolved by the water. It's like a rock band exiting the limousine into a crowd of fans and becoming separated as each band member gets surrounded by his own circle of fans. If the atoms in solid salt were not ionized to begin with, the water would not do such a good job dissolving the salt.";though,done,say,difficulty,sitting
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2012;Aug Sep;How does plasma make a campfire flame orange?;The de-excitation of plasma (charged gas) is not the source of the light given off by a campfire's flame. The incandescence of solid soot particles billowing up on an updraft of hot air is what creates the light seen as a flame. Let us look at the typical ways materials emit light and then apply it to the campfire.;"Electrons in molecules can exist in various orbital states. When electrons absorb energy, they are lifted to a higher energy state in the molecule. This is roughly similar to lifting a ball onto a high shelf where it can fall back down from. The absorbed energy of the electron is stored as potential energy as it sits in the higher energy state. Many things can excite an electron in a molecule to a higher energy state, including chemical reactions, collisions with other particles, and absorption of light. Eventually, excited electrons fall back down to their lower states, like a ball on a shelf rolling and falling back to the ground. When the electrons fall, their potential energy is lost and given off. There are many ways that a falling (de-exciting) electron can give off its energy, but the most common way is for it to emit a bit of light called a photon. As a result, any process that excites electrons leads to light being created when they de-excite. Often, this light has a non-visible color or is too dim to be seen by human eyes, but the light is still being created.

Because of the law of conservation of energy (which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed), all of the energy that the electron loses in transitioning from a higher state to a lower state must be given to the photon that it creates. Electron states only exist at fixed levels that are constant for a given molecule, so a certain isolated molecule can only emit photons of specific energies. Because a photon's frequency (the light's color) is directly proportional to its energy, certain isolated molecules can only emit certain colors of light. The specific set of colors that a molecule emits (its spectrum) is unique to the molecule and acts like a fingerprint. Astronomers can tell what chemicals a star is made out of by simply looking at what colors are present in its starlight. By plotting the few, distinct colors present in the light given off by a single molecule, a ""line spectrum"" is formed, which looks like a collection of thin lines. In addition to electrons getting excited, the whole molecule itself can get excited by spinning more or vibrating more. There are therefore three ways a molecule can emit light: an electron falls to a lower state (electron transition), the molecule spins less (rotational transition), and the molecule vibrates less (vibrational transition).

Now something interesting happens if you have more than one molecule involved. If you have a collection of molecules, they tend to bump into each other. When they collide, some of the energy in the excited electrons, excited spinning states, and excited vibrating states is converted simply to movement (kinetic energy). As a result, there is less energy present for the photon that is emitted when the molecule transitions, leading to a photon with a color that is different from if there had been no collision. Because the collisions are random, the color changes of the light given off are random. Where there was just one color (a line) in a certain portion of the spectrum of the light emitted, there are now many colors. Collisions between molecules therefore tend to smear the nice crisp lines of the light's color spectrum into bands with many colors. The more collisions there are and the harder they are, the more colors there are in the light given off.

If there is a very high amount of strong collisions between molecules, all of the light given off by molecular transitions gets smeared into one continuous band of colors. In such a case, all colors of the rainbow are present in the light and the light is therefore white. The light is typically not pure white, but is whitish red, whitish orange, etc. depending on the nature of the collisions. Light with this broad arrangement of colors is called ""thermal radiation"" or ""blackbody radiation"" and the process that creates this light is called ""incandescence"". In every day life, we refer to incandescence as ""glowing hot"". A material with zero collisions therefore emits a line spectrum, which is a collection of a few perfectly defined, unsmeared colors. On the other extreme, a material with an infinite number of collisions emits a blackbody spectrum, which is a perfectly smooth collection of all colors in a very distinct distributional shape called a ""blackbody curve"". The two opposite extremes; the line spectrum and the blackbody spectrum; are idealizations. In the real world, each spectrum is somewhere between the two extremes. When we say that the color distribution of light is a line spectrum, we mean that it is close to a line spectrum, and not that it is exactly a line spectrum.

There are two things that determines how fast molecules collide with each other. The first is the density of the molecules. The closer the molecules are together, the more chance they have to collide. Solids have their molecules very close together and therefore collide enough to emit all colors of light. Solids typically emit a spectrum that is close to a blackbody spectrum. On the other hand, a dilute gas has its molecules much farther apart, so the color distribution of its emitted light looks more like a line spectrum. The other thing that affects the collision rate is the temperature of the object. As an object gets hotter, its molecules shake around more and move faster, which leads to more collisions. More collisions means more spectral line spreading, and it also means that more energy is being exchanged in each collision. The thermal spectral curve shifts to higher energies for higher temperatures, which is the same as higher frequencies. Room temperature objects are constantly emitting light in a color we can't see (infrared). As we heat up an object such as an electric stove element, the collisions between molecules become more intense and more frequent. The light given off therefore has a spectral thermal distribution that shifts to higher frequencies. The peak of the light given off by a heated object shifts from infrared, to red, to orange, and so on as it gets hotter. But remember, that thermal radiation contains all colors, so that hot metal does not glow red, it actually glows whitish red, and then whitish orange as it gets hotter, etc. (Remember that ""white"" is just how we experience an equal mixture of all colors.)

Let us look at some examples. A neon sign contains a gas at normal temperature getting excited by electricity. The light emitted by a neon sign is therefore close to a line spectrum (just a few, sharply defined colors). In contrast, the sun contains gas, but the gas is at such a high temperature that the light emitted is close to a blackbody spectrum. The metal elements in a toaster, electric stove, and incandescent light bulb are all solid and therefore glow when heated such that the light they produce is close to a blackbody spectrum, which contains all colors and therefore is whitish.";"Now let us apply this to a campfire's flame. At first thought, you may think that the space where the flame exists only contains gases, therefore the light emitted should be a line spectrum with only a few distinct colors. This is clearly not the case. The flame has a broad range of colors, from red to orange to yellow and all the colors in between. So there must be more going on than heated gases. The best general description of a campfire flame's color is: whitish orange. This description matches exactly what we would expect from the thermal radiation of incandescence. It turns out that a campfire flame contains small solid particles of half-burnt wood called ""soot"" that are so hot that they glow. They glow in the exact same way that electric stove elements glow. When you look at a whitish-orange flame, you are looking at a cloud of little, hot, glowing, solid bits of half burnt fuel. The hot air that is flowing upwards catches this glowing soot and carries it upwards. As the soot rises, it cools and its thermal spectrum shifts to ever lower colors. That is why the bottom of a flame is whitish-yellow, and as you look higher, it changes to whitish-orange, and then whitish-red, and then to whitish-infrared (which we can't see, but can feel with our hands). The flame of a campfire actually extends meters into the air, we just can't see the top portion because the soot has cooled enough to emit mostly infrared colors.

Interestingly, the presence of half-burnt soot in a flame, and therefore the flame's whitish color, is a result of there not being enough oxygen. If oxygen is pumped fast enough into the fire, or is premixed properly with the fuel, all of the fuel gets burned all the way and there is no soot. Adding enough extra oxygen therefore makes the whitish-orange flame go away. The color that remains in the flame (usually blue) is from the electron transitions involved in the chemical reaction itself. Fuels that don't need much oxygen to burn, such as the natural gas in a gas stove, can burn without giving off whitish-orange glowing half-burnt particles.";liquid,natural,driven,care,behavior
Cambridge;AS;1123 - English Language;2003;Oct Nov;"How does tomato juice make skunk smell go away?
";Tomato juice does not make skunk odor go away. More specifically, tomato juice does not react chemically with the skunk odor to destroy it. Instead, it simply has a strong enough smell on its own to partially mask the skunk smell. But in this respect, it is no different from any other strong odor. Perfume or scented candles will do just as well as tomato juice to mask the skunk smell.;As soon as the tomato juice scent wears away, the skunk odor becomes noticeable again. A better approach is to deactivate the skunk spray through chemical reactions. Your allies in this effort are bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and backing soda. Wash clothes and fabrics that have the skunk smell in bleach. To clean hard surfaces that have the skunk odor, spray on a cleaning solution that contains bleach, let it sit, and then wipe off. To clean items that can not withstand bleach, such as pet fur or colored clothes, instead use a hydrogen peroxide/baking soda solution. Combine one quart of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 1/4 cup baking soda and 2 tbsp. liquid dish detergent for an excellent skunk odor killer that is safe enough to bath pets in. For best results, this solution should be scrubbed into the fur or fabric while still foaming. Note that this mixture is potentially explosive if left to sit too long in a sealed container. Discard the unused portion instead of storing it.;The culprits in skunk spray are chemicals called thiols which contain sulfur. Skunk spray also contain thioacetates, which degrade slowly into stinky thiols. This degradation process is what gives skunk odor its longevity. Reactive agents such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide work to deactivate the thiols and thioacetates.;try,under,freedom,standard,which
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2002;Aug Sep;"What is it about the ocean that makes it look blue when it reflects the sky?
";"The ocean is not blue just because it reflects the sky. The ocean is mostly blue because water itself is blue. In a Journal of Chemical Education paper titled ""Why Is Water Blue?"" by Charles L. Braun and Sergei N. Smirnov, water is shown to have a slight intrinsic blue color. It takes a large quantity of water, like in the ocean, for humans to notice the blueness.";In household uses, like when drinking a glass of water, we use far too little water to notice its blueness. As a result, we think it is always clear. According to Braun and Smirnov, water absorbs red light due to vibrational transitions of the molecules, leaving the blue light to reflect back. For the same reason, large volumes of snow and ice also have a blue tinge. Sensitive laboratory equipment verifies the faint blue color of water even when only a cupful is present.;Note that if the ocean's surface is calm and you look at in from a low viewing angle, then some of the blue color on the water's surface is the reflection of the sky. But the reflection of the sky does not totally account for the blueness of water.;yard,badly,rest,region,stairs
Cambridge;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2016;Jan Feb;"What is the difference between a chemical process and a physical process in chemistry?
";There is no real difference between a chemical process and a physical process in chemistry. Some chemistry teachers like to define a chemical process as any process that involves a chemical reaction and all other processes as physical processes.;"According to such teachers, things like burning fuels are chemical processes and things like dissolving salt in water or freezing water into ice are physical processes. But this distinction is really arbitrary and non-fundamental. While such teachers may make such a distinction with the good intention of teaching their students, they are really setting up the students to be confused in the long term.

All processes that involve the interaction of atoms are chemical. Dissolving salt in water is a chemical reaction. You start with two distinct reactants (salt and water), get the atoms to bind to each other in new ways (each salt ion becomes bound to a crowd of water molecules), and a new chemical is formed (salt water). Typical of all chemical reactions, heat is exchanged with the environment as part of the process. Dissolving salt in water may not be as glamorous as exploding a balloon filled with hydrogen, but it is still a chemical reaction.

Even processes as simple as changes in phase (solid to liquid, liquid to gas, etc.) are really chemical in nature. In the process of freezing to ice, the molecules in liquid water start in one configuration, form bonds as they take on the new configuration, and release energy in the process. Some teachers don't like to treat phase changes as chemical reactions because the basic chemical equations are not very useful in teaching students. For instance, the basic chemical equation for water freezing to ice is: H20 â†’ H20. This equation is misleading. It seems to imply nothing is happening at all. For this reason, some may think that phase changes don't really count. But a more detailed chemical equation is more illuminating: H20(liquid) â€“ heat â†’ H20(solid) . Contained in that arrow is the formation of stable hydrogen bonds between water molecules after the removal of energy (energy is always released when chemical bonds are formed). The formation of bonds is the key feature of chemical reactions.

In fact, just about every day-to-day experience that we are familiar with is fundamentally chemical in nature. Kicking a football, changing gears on a bike, singing, and writing words on paper are all described on the fundamental level as the interaction of atoms. On the fundamental level, the only processes that are not chemical in nature are gravitational processes and nuclear/subatomic-particle processes.

Furthermore, the term ""physical process"" is so vague as to be useless. Every observable process in the universe is physical. The only things in the universe that are not physical are abstract concepts such as love and faith. All chemical processes are physical, as are all biological, geological, astronomical, gravitational, subatomic, and nuclear processes. The book ""Misconceptions in Chemistry"" by Hans-Dieter Barke states:";"It is traditional in chemistry lessons to separate chemical reactions from physical processes. The formation of metal sulfides from its elements by releasing energy is described in every case as a chemical reaction. In contrast, the dissolving of substances in water is often regarded as a ""physical process"" because matter ""does not actually change"", the dissolved substance can be regained in its original form through ""physical"" separation procedures. If one takes sodium hydroxide and dissolves it in a little water, a colorless solution appears and releases heat; the solution conducts electricity and produces a high pH value. Critical students regard this solution as being a new material and the production of heat shows an exothermic reaction. From this example one can see that it does not make any sense to separate the transformation of matter into ""chemical"" and ""physical"" processes [8]. If we routinely continue to do this in the sense of ""we've always done it this way"", automatic school-made misconceptions would arise based on teaching traditions in school.";exist,though,nuts,trap,natural
Edexcel;A;2281 - Economics,;2010;Jan Feb;"What kind of crystal are crystal drinking glasses made out of?
";"""Crystal"" glasses are not made out of crystal at all. The naming of certain types of glass as ""crystal"" is a confusing and inaccurate historical tradition. A crystal is any material that has its molecules aligned spatially into regularly repeating patterns.";"Metals, ceramics, salts, ice, sugar, and rocks are all crystal. ""Crystal"" glass is not. In fact, the term ""crystal glass"" is a pure oxymoron. By definition, glasses are materials that have their molecules unordered. In other words, the very definition of glass is a material that is not a crystal.

So what is ""crystal"" glass made of if not crystal? Traditionally, ""crystal"" glass was just regular glass where the calcium is replaced with lead oxide. A more accurate name is therefore ""lead glass"". Adding lead to glass raises its index of refraction. The index of refraction measures the amount that a material bends light. Materials with a higher index of refraction sparkle more because they bend light more. One of the materials with the highest index of refraction is diamond. That is why diamond sparkles so much. Adding lead to glass makes it look more like diamond, hence lead glass became identified as crystal-looking glass, which got shortened to ""crystal glass"". In this way, adding lead to glass allows an artist to make a candle holder or a wine cup that looks like diamond without actually needing to use diamond, which would be prohibitively expensive.";"Adding lead also makes the glass easier to work with, so that more intricate designs can be cut into the glass. In our modern day, lead is recognized to be poisonous to humans, so ""crystal"" glass actually has barium or zinc now instead of lead.";smoke,seat,failed,properly,limited

";The hole in the ozone over Antarctica still exists, but it is no longer the threat it once was according to an October 2012 NASA press release. According to NASA, the hole appears and disappears every year due to a complex interplay of seasonal weather patterns.;Ozone blocks most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, which would otherwise reach earth's surface and cause more skin cancer. The hole in the ozone, which in reality is more like a region of partial depletion than a complete hole, was dangerously increasing in size in the 1980's and 1990's. Research indicated that use of man-made CFC chemicals such as found in aerosol cans contributed to depleting the ozone. As a result the U.S. banned the use of CFC's in aerosol cans in 1978. Other countries have imposed similar CFC bans and efforts to enact additional bans are under way. ;As a consequence of these legal measures, the hole in the ozone stopped expanding from year to year and is slowly shrinking back to its 1980's state.;badly,honor,feel,applied,brick
Edexcel;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2014;Oct Nov;"What makes a ""fluorescent"" highlighter marker so bright?
";"Fluorescent highlighter markers are so bright because they are literally fluorescent. When used to describe highlighters, the word ""fluorescent"" is not a vague term that means ""extra bright"". Rather, this word is an exact, scientific term indicating that the highlighter ink exhibits fluorescence. Fluorescence is the phenomenon where a material absorbs light of a certain color and then emits light of a different color with a longer wavelength. The most striking type of fluorescence involves the absorption of ultraviolet rays (which humans can't see) and the subsequent emission of light in the visible spectrum (which humans can see). Because humans can't see the original ultraviolet light, a fluorescent object looks like it is glowing mysteriously on its own when it is illuminated only by ultraviolet rays in a dark room . For this reason, ultraviolet lights and fluorescent materials can add an intriguing look to darkened rooms at parties and events. Since highlighters contain fluorescent chemicals, the marks made by highlighters will seem to eerily glow on their own when placed in a dark room with an ultraviolet light (e.g. a ""black light"").

";"When a fluorescent object is illuminated by both visible light and ultraviolet light (such as when illuminated by sunlight), the object will still convert the ultraviolet light to visible light. The visible light created by the object's fluorescence gets added to the visible light reflected off the object. As a result, a human observes a fluorescent object that is under full illumination to be unusually bright instead of eerily glowing on its own. Note that this is a physical effect and not a psychological effect. A fluorescent object does not just seem to be brighter. A fluorescent object is physically brighter in the visible spectrum when under full illumination than other non-fluorescent, non-glowing objects.

For example, take a normal yellow marker and a yellow highlighter marker which contains a yellow fluorescent chemical mixed into the ink. Draw with both markers on normal white paper. When visible light and ultraviolet light shines on the paper, such as from the sun or from a normal light bulb, the fluorescent marker ink will always be brighter in the visible-light portion of the spectrum than the normal ink. Furthermore, the fluorescent ink is brighter in the visible spectrum than can be accounted for by the original visible light present. For this reason, fluorescent objects under full illumination appear unnaturally bright. The effect of highlighter ink appearing unnaturally bright under normal illumination and the effect of highlighter ink glowing eerily when illuminated by an ultraviolet light in a dark room are the exact same effect: fluorescence. Fluorescent chemicals are also sometimes added to paper, posterboard, paint, and clothing to make them appear unnaturally bright. Fluorescence in this context is often informally called ""neon colors"" even though fluorescence has nothing to do with the element neon. A shirt that is referred to as ""neon green"" should more accurately be described as ""fluorescent green"".Fluorescent chemicals are added to construction worker vests to make them unusually bright. Note that computer monitors do not exhibit fluorescence, so this image does not accurately reproduce the unusual brightness of these vests. Public Domain Image, source: U.S. Department of Transportation. Note that the extra brightness of a fluorescent object is due to its conversion of ultraviolet light to visible light. As such, a fluorescent object will only appear unnaturally bright if ultraviolet light is present. If normal yellow ink and fluorescent yellow highlighter ink are both illuminated only by a yellow laser in a dark room, they will both be equally bright. Also note that the extra brightness of highlighter ink is due to the fluorescent chemicals that are mixed in. This extra brightness will not be reproduced by systems that have no fluorescent chemicals. For example, a photocopy machine does not contain fluorescent chemicals. This means that when you make a color photocopy of a document containing highlighter marks, the marks in the duplicate document will not contain fluorescent chemicals. As such, the highlighter marks on the duplicate document will not look unnaturally bright. Making a color photocopy of a document containing highlighting marks is an easy and striking way for you to see the effect that the fluorescent chemical has on the ink's appearance.";"On the molecular scale, fluorescence is caused by an electron making several downward transitions after making a single upward transition. When an electron absorbs a bit of light, it transitions to a higher energy state inside the molecule. When an electron transitions down to a lower energy state, it must lose some energy and can do so by emitting a bit of light. The frequency, and therefore color, of the light that is absorbed or emitted by the electron is a function of how far the electron transitions along the energy scale. A large transition downward means that the electron must get rid of a lot energy. Thus if it emits light, the light must have high energy, which corresponds to high frequency (more towards the blue/violet/ultraviolet end of the spectrum). A small transition downward means that the electron only needs to get rid of a little bit of energy, so that the light it emits is low energy/low frequency (more towards the orange/red/infrared end of the spectrum).

For regular materials, an electron in a molecule absorbs a bit of the light shining on it, causing it to transition upwards. Then the electron transitions right back down to where it started, making just as big of a leap downwards on energy scale as its original upwards leap. As a result, the light it emits is the same color as the light that hits it. We refer to this effect as standard reflection. (Some of the incident colors can also be absorbed, so that the reflected colors equals the incident colors minus the absorbed colors.) For fluorescent materials, the electron absorbs a bit of high-energy light such as ultraviolet, and therefore it makes a large transition up the energy scale, but then it loses some of its energy to increasing the vibrations of the molecule before it has a chance to transition back down and emit light. As a result, when the electron finally does transition down and emit light, it has less energy to lose, it makes a smaller leap down, and it therefore emits lower-energy/lower-frequency light. In this way, electrons in fluorescent materials such as highlighter ink are able to transform high-energy bits of ultraviolet light into low-energy bits of visible light by converting some of the energy of the incident ultraviolet light into molecular vibrations, which ultimately becomes heat.";differ,poor,sitting,thick,smoke
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2008;May Jun;"When does the breaking of chemical bonds release energy?
";The breaking of chemical bonds never releases energy to the external environment. Energy is only released when chemical bonds are formed. In general, a chemical reaction involves two steps: 1) the original chemical bonds between the atoms are broken, and 2) new bonds are formed. These two steps are sometimes lumped into one event for simplicity, but they are really two separate events. For instance, when you burn methane (natural gas) in your stove, the methane is reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. Chemists often write this as:;"This balanced chemical equation summarizes the chemical reaction involved in burning methane. The reactants are on the left, the products are on the right, and the arrow represents the moment the reaction happens. But there are a lot of interesting things happening that are hidden behind that arrow. A more detailed equation would look something like this: The first line of the equation contains the original reactants: methane molecules and oxygen molecules. The first arrow represents the breaking of the bonds, which requires energy. On the middle line are the atoms, now broken out of molecules and free to react. The second arrow represents the forming of new bonds. On the last line are the final products. It takes a little energy, such as the spark from the igniter in your stove, to get the reaction started. That is because bonds must be broken before the atoms can be formed into new bonds, and it always takes energy to break bonds. Once the reaction has started, the output energy from one burned methane molecule becomes the input energy for the next molecule. Some of the energy released by each bond that is formed in making carbon dioxide and water is used to break more bonds in the methane and oxygen molecules. In this way, the reaction becomes self-sustaining (as long as methane and oxygen continue to be supplied). The igniter can be turned off. If breaking bonds did not require energy, then fuels would not need an ignition device to start burning. They would just start burning on their own. The presence of spark plugs in your car attests to the fact that breaking chemical bonds requires energy. (Note that the combustion of methane actually involves many smaller steps, so the equation above could be expanded out into even more detail.)

The textbook Advanced Biology by Michael Roberts, Michael Jonathan Reiss, and Grace Monger states: Biologists often talk about energy being made available by the breakdown of sugar, implying that the breaking of chemical bonds in the sugar molecules releases energy. And yet in chemistry we learn that energy is released, not when chemical bonds are broken, but when they are formed. In fact, respiration supplies energy, not by the breaking of bonds in the substrate, but by the formation of strong bonds in the products. However, the overall result of the process is to yield energy, and it is in this sense that biologists talk about the breakdown of sugar giving energy.";"The total energy input or output of a reaction equals the energy released in forming new bonds minus the energy used in breaking the original bonds. If it takes more energy to break the original bonds than is released when the new bonds are formed, then the net energy of the reaction is negative. This means that energy must be pumped into the system to keep the reaction going. Such reactions are known as endothermic. If if takes less energy to break the original bonds than is released when new bonds are formed, then the net energy of the reaction is positive. This fact means that the energy will flow out of the system as the reaction proceeds. This fact also means that the reaction can proceed on its own without any external energy once started. Such reactions are known as exothermic. (Endothermic reactions can also proceed on their own if there is enough external energy in the form of ambient heat to be absorbed.) Exothermic reactions tend to heat up the surrounding environment while endothermic reactions tend to cool it down. The burning of fuels is exothermic because there is a net release of energy. Cooking an egg is endothermic because there is a net intake of energy to make the egg cooked. The bottom line is that both endothermic and exothermic reactions involve the breaking of bonds, and both therefore require energy to get started.

It makes sense that breaking bonds always takes energy. A chemical bond holds two atoms together. To break the bond, you have to fight against the bond, like stretching a rubber band until it snaps. Doing this takes energy. As an analogy, think of atoms as basketballs. Think of the energy landscape of chemical bonds as a hilly terrain that the basketballs are rolling over. When two balls are placed near a round hole, gravity pulls them down to the bottom where they meet and stop. The two balls now stay close together because of the shape of the hole and the pull of gravity. This is like the chemical bond uniting atoms. To get the balls away from each other (to break the bonds), you have to roll them up opposite sides of the hole. It takes the energy of your hand pushing the balls to get them up the sides of the hole and away from each other. The energy you put into the system in order to pull apart the balls is now stored as potential energy in the balls. Atoms don't literally roll up and down hills, but they act like they are moving in an energy landscape that is very similar to real hills.";directly,product,man,still,universe
Cambridge;A;2281 - Economics,;2001;Aug Sep;"When hang-drying clothes, which is faster, indoors or outdoors?
";The answer to this question really depends on your situation. Let us state the question more concretely: we have a clean, wet load of laundry that just got washed. We want to dry the clothes as quickly as possible but only have the option of hanging up the clothes to dry. Would it be quicker to dry the clothes by hanging them indoors or outdoors? Before we can make sense of the answer to this question, we need to review the basics.;"When a wet object dries, it is because the liquid water that is on the object evaporates to water vapor and diffuses out into the air. On the molecular scale, object wetness consists of many water molecules loosely and non-statically bonded to each other in liquid form, as well as bonded to the object. Drying consists of individual water molecules breaking free of their bonds to each other and to the object, and then flying out into the air. The speed at which a wet object dries is therefore determined by the net evaporation rate of the liquid water on the object.

In general, the drying rate of a particular wet object is influenced by three main factors: the temperature of the liquid water on the object, the concentration of the water molecles in the surrounding air, and the air flow rate.

1. Temperature.
As you may know, liquid water boils and forms water vapor when its temperature is high enough to break the intermolecular bonds holding the water molecules together. However, even when the water's temperature is below the boiling point, some of the water molecules in the liquid break off into the air and become water vapor. How is this possible? The key is that not every water molecule in liquid water has the same energy. The temperature of a cup of liquid water does not tell us the exact energy of every single molecule. Rather, the temperature gives us an idea of the average energy of all of the molecules. Because of the random, jostling nature of thermal motion, some molecules in a cup of water end up with far more energy than the average, and some molecules end up with less energy than the average. The molecules with more energy than the average often have enough energy to break free of their liquid-state intermolecular bonds and shoot off into the freedom of air. In this way, some amount of water molecules will always evaporate from the surface of liquid water, no matter the temperature of the liquid water. The higher the temperature of the liquid water, the more molecules there are on the high end of the distribution with enough energy to evaporate. Therefore, the hotter an object, the quicker it dries, even if its temperature is below the boiling point of water.

diagram of molecular motion during evaporation
Water molecules on the surface of liquid water are evaporating into air at the same time that water molecules in the air are condensing onto the liquid water. In order for the liquid water to completely evaporate away, thus leaving the clothes dry, water molecules must leave the surface more quickly than they return. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
Now let's apply these concepts to our wet clothes. There are two common things which can warm up the hanging clothes and thus make them dry quicker: ambient hot air, and light. All else being equally, wet clothes hanging on a hot day will dry much quicker than wet clothes hanging on a cold day. Similarly, all else being equal, wet clothes hanging in the sunlight will dry much quicker than wet clothes hanging in the dark.

2. Concentration of Water Molecules in the Surrounding Air.
Now the story gets more complicated. Not only do water molecules leave the surface of the liquid water and shoot off into air, water molecules that are in the air also bump into the liquid water and stick there. If water molecules are joining the liquid water as quickly as they are leaving, the object will never dry. In fact, if water molecules join the liquid water faster than they leave, the object will get more wet over time and not less! In order to get an object to dry quickly, we want a lot of water molecules in the liquid water to break free and shoot off into the air, while at the same time, we want very few water molecules in the air to condense onto the liquid water. For fast drying, we therefore want the surrounding air to have a low concentration of water molecules. The concentration of water molecules in the air is commonly called the ""humidity"". The more humid the surrounding air, the slower a wet object dries.";"Returning to our wet clothes hung up to dry, they will dry more quickly in a room with dry air than in a room with humid air. If you live in a region of the world where the outdoor air is very humid (e.g. a tropical rain forest), it is likely that indoor air will be less humid than outdoor air. In this case, the clothes will generally dry more quickly indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, if you live in a region of the world where the outdoor air is very dry (e.g. a desert), it is likely that outdoor air is less humid and the clothes will dry more quickly outdoors. In most regions between these two extremes, the outdoor humidity varies significantly through the year, and even day to day.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if the room is small and not well ventilated, the humidity can build up in the room as the hanging clothes dry. The water molecules coming off the clothes as they dry will fill up the room's air more and more, giving more chance for them to land back on the clothes. In this way, wet clothes in a small, unventilated room will dry more slowly than wet clothes in a large, well-ventilated room, all else being equal. If the outdoor air has low humidity, ""effective ventilation"" can simply mean opening a window.

3. Air Flow Rate.
If the air is perfectly motionless, the water vapor that comes off of an object that is drying will tend to stay mostly near the surface of the object. Although the water molecules in the air will diffuse throughout the whole room because of their random jostling motion, diffusion is a slow process. Because the evaporated water molecules mostly stay close to the surface of the object, they have a lot of opportunity to bump into the object, condense back to liquid, and slow down the drying process. In contrast, if the air is moving, the water molecules that evaporate are swept away before they have a chance to reattach to the object. In this way, air flowing past the surface of a wet object speeds up evaporation. More accurately, air flow will only speed up evaporation if the new air flowing past the object has a lower humidly than the air it is displacing. The harder we blow dry air across an object, the faster it will dry. Applying this concept to our wet clothes hung up to dry, they will indeed dry faster in the breeze than in a spot with no wind, all else being equal.

With these three factors in mind, clothes will dry the fastest when hung up outdoors in a dry, sunny, hot, windy climate. Note that hanging clothes in direct sunlight will cause the colors in the clothes to fade. For those who live in a humid, overcast, cold, non-windy climate, clothes will dry the fastest when hung indoors in a room with low humidity, high temperature, lots of light, and moving air. In other words, turn up the heat, turn up the dehumidifier, turn on some fans, and open the curtains (but not the windows) if you live in the wrong kind of climate and want to maximize drying rates. For those of us who live in regions that are between these two extremes, to determine whether outdoors or indoors is better, we need to ask ourselves the questions: Is the outdoor air less humid than the indoor air? Is the outdoor air warmer than the indoor air? Is outdoors brighter than indoors? Is outdoors breezier than indoors? If the answer to most of these questions is ""yes"", then the clothes will dry faster outdoors.

The worst place to dry clothes is in a damp, dark, cold, unventilated basement â€“ that is, unless you place the clothes in a clothes dryer machine that sits in the basement â€“ then it's the best place to dry clothes.";bell,planning,acres,pleasant,third
Cambridge;AS;3204 - Bengali;2009;Jan Feb;"Which sunscreens are chemical-free?
";"All sunscreens contain chemicals. Everything in the universe that contains atoms is by definition a chemical or a mixture of chemicals. Water is a chemical. Salt, gold, and oxygen are also chemicals. The only physical entities that are not chemicals are unbound fundamental particles, which are known as ""radiation"". Radiation includes light (streams of photons), cathode rays (streams of electrons), beta rays (streams of positrons or electrons), neutron radiation (streams of neutrons), and cosmic rays (streams of protons). Aside from radiation and non-physical entities such as love and hate, everything else in the universe is a chemical or a collection of chemicals. Even a sunscreen that contains just pure water is not chemical-free because water is a chemical. A consumer product that advertises itself as ""chemical-free"" is categorically lying (unless the bottle contains pure radiation, which is unlikely because radiation is notoriously hard to trap in a bottle without quickly destroying it).";"In popular culture, the word ""chemical"" is often used as shorthand for ""dangerous chemical"" or ""man-made chemical"". But labeling a chemical as dangerous is highly subjective and misleading. Few people would call water a dangerous chemical, and yet water can kill you if you drink too much. Jennete Killpack knows this all too well. Jennete is serving time in prison for killing her daughter by forcing her to drink too much water. Many people would consider hydrochloric acid a dangerous chemical, and yet the human stomach naturally produces hydrochloric acid for beneficial purposes. What makes a chemical dangerous is its concentration, and not just its reactivity.

Similarly, the phrase ""man-made chemical"" is subjective and misleading. A pure sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) extracted from a salt mine and a pure sample of sodium chloride fabricated in the lab are exactly identical in every way. Atoms don't have memories or birthmarks. Pure NaCl behaves and reacts in exactly the same way no matter where it came from. The label ""man-made"" is therefore meaningless when applied to chemicals that are also found in nature. Perhaps when people say ""man-made chemical"", they mean ""impure chemical"". If that is their implication, they have it exactly backwards. Chemicals created in the lab tend to be more pure than the same chemicals found in nature. That is one of the driving motivations for processing chemicals in a lab. Refined table salt, such as you purchase at the grocery store, is far cleaner and purer than salt shoveled right out of a salt mine.";"Let us return to the original question and rephrase it as, ""which sunscreens are the healthiest?"". The answer is: which ever ones successfully block ultraviolet sunlight and at the same time have the lowest concentration of overly reactive chemicals such as PABA. To get a more specific answer than that, you would have to analyze every sunscreen ever produced, its ingredients, the reactivity of its ingredients, and the concentration of its ingredients. Such a project lies beyond my resources. If you are curious, the FDA does just that very thing.";basis,say,not,universe,found
Edexcel;A;5070 - Chemistry;2007;Oct Nov;"Why are crystals rare?
";"Crystals are in fact very common. Take a look around you when you sit down to dinner. Your metal knife is a crystal, as are your spoons, forks, and metal serving bowls. The ice in your cup is a crystal, as is the salt in your shaker. Your ceramic plates and bowls are also crystals. Interestingly, your ""crystal"" wine cups are actually one of the few items in your house that are not crystal. Looking into the kitchen, you see your metal fridge, your metal sink, your granite counter tops, your tiled floor, your plaster walls, and your electronic gadgets â€“ all crystal. In fact, aside from glass and organic material such as wood, cotton, or bamboo, almost all solids are crystal.";"There are even some liquids that are crystal, such as in your iPod screen. In science, the word ""crystal"" describes a material that has an ordered spatial arrangement of its molecules. For instance, salt molecules line up in straight columns and rows when forming a salt crystal. Almost all metals, ceramics, salts, rocks, and semiconductors form crystals when in the solid state. Glass, on the other hand, has its molecules randomly distributed. Organic materials such as wood and cotton have highly complex biological structures on the molecular level and therefore do not have the simple repeating patterns characteristic of crystals. But simple organic molecules, such as sugar, do form crystals if they are concentrated and solidified.

The word ""crystal"" is used in popular culture to refer to an object that should be more accurately described as a ""pretty crystal"". The only difference between quartz drops hanging from expensive chandeliers and sand thrown out on the streets is that the chandelier drops are big and pure enough to be pretty. Both are made of silicon dioxide crystals. When the average person says ""crystal"", they mean ""pretty crystal"". Unfortunately, society's obsession with the prettier instances of crystal has lead to the belief that only pretty crystals are crystal. Trying to tell a friend that the copper wires in her lamp cord are just as crystal as the diamond on her finger may illicit stares of disbelief because copper wires aren't pretty. This fascination with the beauty of certain crystals has even lead to belief in the healing power of crystals. The belief that crystals can give humans energy or healing power is nonsensical and unscientific. If the sparkly chunk of calcite in your hand can heal you because it's a crystal, then so can your fridge or your sink because they are also crystals. If beautiful quartz gems can give you energy, then so can the sand you use to clean up oil spills in the garage. They are both made out of the exact same thing: crystallized silicon dioxide. Psychologist Christopher French carried out numerous controlled experiments with pretty crystals where he found that they had no healing power or energy effect at all. He used genuine pretty crystals and phony copies made out of regular glass. He then gave these items to various believers and non-believers in crystal healing to see if they could tell the difference between the real crystals and the fakes. If crystals emit human energy, then people should be able to detect the real items from the fake by sensing this energy. Dr. French found that both groups of people could do no better than random chance at detecting the real crystals from the fakes.";As should now be evident, crystals are not rare. But pretty crystals seem to be rare. Why? The answer is twofold: erosion and mixed composition. Wind, rain, and water flow have a way of knocking and mixing around things here on earth. This erosion causes big crystals such as a palm-sized amethyst to get knocked apart into little crystals. The result is sand, silt, and clay. The earth is covered with sand, silt, and clay as opposed to being covered with giant gem-quality crystals partly because of erosion. Also, when rocks are forming inside the earth, a mixed composition means that crystals of one material get in the way of the crystals of another material while they are forming. As a result, the crystals end up small. For instance, solid granite is a mixture of small quartz, mica, and feldspar crystals. The specks of grains you see in granite are the individual crystals.;should,personal,free,plural,pleasant
Cambridge;O;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2008;Oct Nov;Why are there so many different kinds of forces in chemistry?;There is only one significant force at work in chemical reactions: the electromagnetic force. There are four fundamental forces in the universe: gravity, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. Gravity is too weak to affect chemical reactions much, seeing as chemical reactions involve the rearranging of tiny atoms. Also, the nuclear forces don't play a role in chemical reactions. If a nuclear force becomes involved, then you are dealing with a nuclear reaction and not a chemical reaction.;"Every facet of chemistry is the result of one force: the electromagnetic force. However, because of the quantum wave nature of particles, this force can take on many forms. In a strict sense, every manifestation of the electromagnetic force is unique, as it depends crucially on the arrangement of atoms, the state of their electrons, their temperature, etc. To foster better understanding, however, chemists place the different forms of the electromagnetic force into broad classes:

Covalent bonds: the binding electromagnetic force that arises between atoms when they closely share electrons in an approximately equal way.
Metallic bonds: the binding electromagnetic force that arises between atoms and the delocalized conduction electrons of the metal.
Ionic bonds: the binding electromagnetic force that arises between atoms that are ionized oppositely (one atom has a net negative charge and the other has a net positive charge).
Ion-dipole bonds: the binding electromagnetic force that arises between molecules due to a permanent or induced electric dipole being attracted to an atom with a net electric charge.
Dipole-dipole bonds: the binding electromagnetic force that arises between molecules due to their permanent electric dipoles.
Hydrogen bonds: a special case of the dipole-dipole bond when hydrogen is involved, making the bond unusually strong.
Rotating dipole-dipole bonds (Keesom bond, a type of Van der Waals bond): a weak, special case of the dipole-dipole bond when the molecules are rotating and not locked in place.";"Dipole-induced dipole bonds (Debye bond, a type of Van der Waals bond): the binding electromagnetic force that arises between a molecule with a permanent electric dipole and a molecule with no permanent electric dipole, but with an induced one.
Induced dipole-induced dipole bonds (London dispersion bond, a type of Van der Waals bonds): the binding electromagnetic force that arises between two molecules without permanent electric dipoles due to the brief mutual induction of dipoles.";differ,plus,sick,toy,room
Edexcel;AS;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2016;Oct Nov;Why do atoms always contain the same number of electrons and protons?;"Atoms do not always contain the same number of electrons and protons, although this state is common. When an atom has an equal number of electrons and protons, it has an equal number of negative electric charges (the electrons) and positive electric charges (the protons). The total electric charge of the atom is therefore zero and the atom is said to be neutral. In contrast, when an atom loses or gains an electron (or the rarer case of losing or gaining a proton, which requires a nuclear reaction), the total charges add up to something other than zero. The atom is then said to be electrically charged, or ""ionized"". There is a major difference between the neutral state and the ionized state. In the neutral state, an atom has little electromagnetic attraction to other atoms.";"Note that the electric field of a neutral atom is weak, but is not exactly zero because the atom is not a point particle. If another atom gets close enough to the atom, they may begin to share electrons. Chemically, we say that the atoms have formed bonds.

In contrast to neutral atoms, the field due to an ionized atom is strong, even at larger distances. The strong electric field of ions makes them strongly attracted to other atoms and molecules, to the point of being highly chemically reactive. Ionized atoms can be free radicals, which are atoms with a dangling bond that are highly reactive. In the human body, free radicals can react with DNA, leading to mutations and possibly cancer. Atoms become ionized when light with enough energy knocks off some of their electrons. Only light waves at the frequencies of X-rays and gamma rays have enough energy to ionize atoms and therefore lead to cancer. The cancer-causing power of only certain frequencies is why you can use your cell phone as much as you want, but you can only get an X-ray image taken on rare occasions. Free radicals occur naturally in your body. They only become dangerous when there are more free radicals than your body can handle.

But not all ions in the body are bad. Because of the charged nature of ions, the human body makes use of them to pass electric signals through nerves. The body also uses ions to control fluid levels and blood pressure. The most-used ions in the human body are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chloride. Ions are also created whenever you electrostatically charge an object, such as when you rub a balloon on your hair. For this reason, your clothes dryer machine can be thought of as an ion maker. As clothes rub together in the machine, electrons get knocked from one atom to another. The result is the all-too familiar static cling. Electricity and strong electric fields do a good job of creating ions (think lightning).";The neutral state of an atom is typically the most stable configuration (unless molecular bonds and the chemical environment complicates the picture), so ions tend to discharge and return to their neutral state over time. The reason for this is that, as an ion, the atom has a strong electric field that attracts the needed electron or the needed atom to take its extra electron. But once the atom becomes neutral, it has an equal number of electrons and protons, it does not have a very strong field, and therefore has little possibility of changing.;moving,seat,deeply,anyway,browserling
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2014;Jan Feb;Why doesn't the planet Uranus explode if it contains so much hydrogen and methane?;The planet Uranus indeed contains a significant amount of hydrogen and methane, both highly flammable gases. However, the burning of methane or hydrogen requires oxygen. Simply put, there is no free oxygen on the planet Uranus. On earth, we are so immersed in oxygen that we tend to take it for granted. Many chemical reactions that require oxygen seem to just happen automatically on earth: metals rust, forests catch fire, and candles burn. We may be tempted to ignore oxygen's role in a chemical reaction since it seems to be always there.;"But oxygen is not always present. If I place metal in a jar containing only argon, it will not rust. If I place a lit candle in a jar with no oxygen, its flame will go out. There is an easy demonstration you can do at home to convince yourself of this fact. Get a bowl and fill it about a quarter full with baking soda and vinegar. The baking soda will react with the vinegar, releasing carbon dioxide gas that fills up the bowl and pushes the oxygen out. If you are careful to not disturb the bowl, then the carbon dioxide will stay in the bowl and keep the oxygen out since carbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen. Now, light a match and slowly move it into the bowl. The moment that the match hits the invisible oxygen-depleted pocket of carbon dioxide gas in the bowl, it will immediately go out. This simple demonstration makes the role of oxygen in combustion obvious.

Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is used as the fuel in many household furnaces and ovens. Household gas leaks are so dangerous because methane is so explosive. However, combustion of methane requires oxygen. Therefore, methane is only explosive and flammable as long as there is oxygen or some other oxidizing agent present. Methane consists of four hydrogen atoms bonded symmetrically to a central carbon atom. When it burns with oxygen, it produces mostly carbon dioxide and water according to the formula:";"CH4 + 2 O2 â†’ CO2 + 2 H2O + energy
Hydrogen is the simplest chemical element, containing just one proton and one electron (and occasionally a neutron or two). Under standard conditions, two hydrogen atoms bond to each other to form a hydrogen molecule, H2. In the presence of oxygen, hydrogen is highly flammable, combusting to form water molecules according to the formula:

2 H2 + O2 â†’ 2 H2O + energy
An example of hydrogen burning is the Space Shuttle Main Engines. The External Tank of the Space Shuttle contained giant tanks of hydrogen and oxygen. These chemicals were pumped into the Main Engines where they were mixed and burned, providing the thrust that helped propel the Space Shuttle into space.

The atmosphere of the planet Uranus contains mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane. Interestingly, the methane in the atmosphere is what gives Uranus its distinctive blue color. Since Uranus contains effectively zero free oxygen, the hydrogen and methane in the atmosphere does not burn or explode.";danger,driven,adventure,hot,toward
Cambridge;O;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2016;Oct Nov;"Why don't metals burn?
";Metals do burn. In fact, most metals release a lot of heat when they burn and are hard to put out. For example, thermite is used to weld train rails together. The fuel in thermite is the metal aluminum. When thermite burns, the aluminum atoms bond with oxygen atoms to form aluminum oxide, releasing a lot of heat and light in the process. As another example, hand-held sparklers use aluminum, magnesium, or iron as the fuel. ;"The flame of a sparkler looks different from the flame of a wood fire because metal tends to burn hotter, quicker, and more completely than wood. This is what gives a lit sparkler its distinctive sparkling flame. In fact, most fireworks contain metal fuels. As another example, old flash tubes used in photography were nothing more than burning bits of magnesium in a glass bulb. Also, the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters used aluminum as the fuel. Some metals, such as sodium, burn so well that we don't make everyday objects out of them. Any boy scout who has started a fire using steel wool can attest to the fact that metals burn.

Still, you may wonder why holding up a lit match to aluminum foil does not make it burn. Similarly, placing a metal pan on a kitchen flame does not make the pan burst into flames. In everyday situations, metal objects don't seem to burn so much. How can this be possible if metals actually do burn? There are three main factors involved.

First, if you have a solid chunk of metal, it is hard to get oxygen atoms close enough to the majority of the metal atoms to react. In order to burn the metal, each metal atom has to get close enough to an oxygen atom to bond to it. For large chunks of metal; like spoons, pots, and chairs; most of the atoms are simply too deeply buried to have any access to oxygen molecules. Furthermore, metals don't vaporize easily. When you burn a chunk of wood or a wax candle, the fuel particles readily vaporize, meaning that with just a little heat, they shoot out into the air where they have better access to oxygen atoms. In contrast, solid metals tend to have their atoms very tightly bound together, meaning that it is much harder to use heat to vaporize the metal. Also, organic materials like wood or cloth contain a lot of their own oxygen, whereas raw metals don't. This is one reason why it is much harder to burn a metal spoon than a wooden spoon, even though they both consist of large chunks of material.

With this fact in mind, all we have to do is manually break apart the metal atoms in order to get them to burn better. In practice, this means grinding the metal down to a fine powder. When used as a fuel in commercial products and industrial processes, metals usually come in the form of a powder. Although, even if you have ground a metal block down to a powder, it still won't burn as efficiently as it could if you just use the oxygen in the ambient air. The problem is that air does not actually contain that much oxygen. Air is mostly nitrogen. The best approach is to mix oxygen directly into the powder. Raw oxygen won't work so well because it is a gas at room temperature and will float away. Instead, solid compounds containing loosely bound oxygen atoms can be mixed into the metal powder. In this way, the oxygen atoms can stably sit right next to the metal atoms, ready to react. This approach is the most efficient way to get metals to burn well. For example, thermite is just aluminum powder (the fuel) mixed in with iron oxide (the oxygen source).

The second reason that everyday metal objects don't burn so well is that metals generally have a higher ignition temperature. Because the atoms in a typical metal are so tightly bound to each other, it takes more energy to break them apart and free them up, even if the oxygen atoms are sitting right next to them. Candle flames, match flames, campfires, and kitchen stove flames simply don't get hot enough to ignite most metals, even if the metal is in the ideal powder form. Chemical reactions that produce higher temperatures must be used to ignite most metals. For example, the combustion of magnesium strips can be used to ignite thermite.";"The last reason that everyday metal objects don't burn so well is that metals tend to be excellent thermal conductors. This means that if a spot on a metal object starts to build up some heat, the heat very quickly flows through the metal to cooler parts of the object. This makes it hard to build up enough heat in one spot to reach the ignition temperature. Even if you have a flame torch running at a high enough temperature, it is difficult to use the torch to ignite a chunk of metal because the heat keeps flowing away through the metal.

In summary, because most atoms in a solid chunk of metal don't have access to oxygen atoms, because metals have a high ignition temperature, and because metals are good thermal conductors, they don't burn very well in everyday situations. The ideal way to get a metal to burn is to grind it into a powder, mix in an oxidizer, contain it so heat can't escape, and then apply a high temperature ignition device.";refer,planning,directly,dropped,ought
Edexcel;O;5070 - Chemistry;2009;May Jun;"Why don't objects fuse to my finger when I touch them?
";Objects always fuse to your finger when you touch them. You often don't notice this for two reasons: 1) Your finger is stronger than the object you are touching. When you pull away, you rip atoms off the object and these atoms remain fused to your finger as a microscopic residue. 2) Your finger is stronger than the bonds fusing you to the object. When you pull away, you simply break the bonds holding you to the object. If you notice this at all, you experience it as a sticky feeling when you pull your finger off of a substance.;"At the atomic level, the fusing of your finger occurs because of chemical bonding. There are several different types of chemical bonds:

Covalent bonding is a very strong bonding between atoms caused by sharing electrons. Covalent bonding will happen if you touch a highly reactive substance. Touch your finger to hydrochloric acid and your finger ""fuses"" just fine with the acid, causing damage. Touch certain glues, and covalent bonding causes the glue to fuse with your finger. Pull your finger way (if possible) and some glue is still bonded to your finger.
Ionic bonding is caused by the giving and taking of electrons. Ionic bonding is responsible for the stickiness of many glues and paints.
Hydrogen bonding is when a partially bare hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to another molecule (or another part of itself). Hydrogen bonding occurs often between molecules in liquids. Stick your finger in water and pull it out. Your finger is wet because some of the water has hydrogen bonded with your finger. If you lick a metal pole on a cold day, the fusing power of hydrogen bonds becomes very evident.
Metallic bonding is what happens between a large number of metallic atoms. Since your finger is not made of metal, it does not bond in this way. Metals will instead bond to your finger in other ways.
Bulk electrostatic bonding is the static cling between large pockets of excess charge on the surface of objects. When you touch a sock just out of the dryer and it sticks to you, it is because it has bonded with you via bulk electrostatic bonding.
Mechanical bonding is what happens when large groups of molecules intertwine. Touch a fishing hook so that it spears your finger and it has mechanically bonded to you. Many machines use mechanical bonds (screws, bolts, latches, ties) so that they can be easily disassembled without changing or damaging the material. At the atomic level, mechanical bonding is due to atomic repulsion between the two objects that are intertwined, keeping them from passing through each other.
Van der Waals bonding happens all the time, but it is most important when none of the above bonding types are available. This bonding is very weak so you often don't notice it. When you pull Saran Wrap out and it sticks to your hand, it is doing this because it has bonded with you via Van der Waals forces.
Note that bonding occurs at the surface of the objects that you are touching. Because of this fact, the act of bonding to every object that you touch does not really change who you are. It just makes your hands dirty, takes off some dead skin cells, or gives you a (sometimes imperceptible) sticky feeling when you pull away. Additionally, every time you experience friction, you are feeling the bonding between you and the rubbing surface slowing you down.";"Examples of objects and substances that will bond strongly enough to your hands for you to notice include:

Cambridge;O;5054 - Physics;2007;Oct Nov;"Why is ice slippery?
";On its own, ice is not slippery. When you step onto an icy sidewalk, you do indeed feel a slippery surface. But the slipperiness is caused by a thin layer of liquid water and not directly by the solid ice itself. Water on a smooth surface is slippery because water is a low-viscosity liquid. As such, there are no permanent intermolecular bonds in liquid water, and the transient intermolecular bonds are weak. This means that water molecules can move about freely, slide past each other easily, and fill any microscopic holes or cracks that would snag an object.;"But how does water get on the ice in the first place? This is a harder question to answer. For many years, scientists thought that the cause was pressure. When you apply pressure to water, you do indeed lower its melting point. In 1886, engineer John Joly proposed that the weight of a person skating on ice created enough pressure to lower the melting point of ice below the ambient temperature, thus causing the ice to melt to a thin layer of water under the skates. But this explanation does not hold up to closer scrutiny. No matter how much pressure you apply, you can't lower the melting point of water below -22 degrees Celsius. And yet, ice at temperatures lower than this still exhibits the formation of a slippery liquid layer. While pressure can play a role, it is not the dominant effect.

In 1939, Frank P. Bowden and T. P. Hughes proposed that the friction of objects sliding on the ice causes it to heat up enough to melt. While friction does indeed cause heat, it does not create enough heat to melt ice that is at a very low temperature. And yet, ice at low temperature still forms a slippery liquid layer. Also, frictional heating cannot explain why a slippery layer forms even if the object is perfectly motionless. While frictional heating can play a role in reducing friction for objects at high speed, it is not the dominant effect.";"The exact details of why ice forms a slippery liquid layer, even when little pressure or friction is applied, is currently not completely settled by scientists and is an ongoing area of research. Ice has been found to always have a thin liquid layer on its surface, even at temperature well below freezing, and even in the absence of contact with any objects. The formation of a surface liquid layer is therefore a property of ice itself and not a property of interacting with an object. The liquid layer seems to arise because the water molecules at the surface have fewer chemical bonds than in bulk, so they can better absorb natural vibrations. In a 2005 Physics Today review article, Robert Rosenberg states, ""The periodic structure breaks down [at the surface] and the molecular layers adopt a more amorphous reconstruction in response to the reduced number of chemical bonds holding the surface molecules in place. Atoms in the outermost surface vibrate with a greater amplitude as a function of temperature than atoms in the interior lattice... Surface melting is attributable to the interaction of the vibrational motion of the surface molecules with the interior bulk molecules.""";adventure,bend,exist,parallel,ought
Cambridge;O;2210 - Computer Science;2012;Jan Feb;"Why is lead used in pencils even though lead is poisonous?
";The core of a pencil does not contain lead and never has. Pencils contain a form of solid carbon known as graphite. According to the book The Pencil by Henry Petroski, the graphite pencil was first developed and popularized in the 1600's. The first users of graphite simply dug this mineral out of the hills and discovered it could be sawed into sticks and used as an excellent writing tool. During the 1600's, no one knew the chemical nature of this material, as chemistry itself was still in its infancy.;"Since this writing material behaved similar to metallic lead, but had a darker color, people began calling it ""black lead"". Eventually, the name of the core of the pencil got shortened to ""lead"". In 1779, German chemist K. W. Scheele finally determined pencil lead to be composed of pure carbon. A decade later, A. G. Werner decided that this carbon material needed a new name and proposed the name ""graphite"" based on the Greek word ""graphein"" which means ""to write"". Black-core pencils currently contain and have always contained graphite, not lead.

Carbon is the sixth element on the periodic table and is famous for forming the backbone of molecules found in fuels and in all living organisms. Aside from biological molecules, carbon can also be found in nature in pure mineral form. Depending on the shapes in which the carbon atoms are bonded, pure carbon can take on many forms. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded tetrahedrally to its four nearest carbon atoms. ";This tightly packed arrangement of carbon atoms makes diamond the hardest naturally occurring material on earth. In contrast, graphite contains a stack of carbon sheets. Each carbon sheet is one atom thick and consists of a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms bonded together. Each carbon atom in the sheet is bonded to the three nearest carbon atoms. The carbon atoms within a sheet are very strongly bound together, but the sheets themselves are very weakly bound. As a result, it is very easy for one carbon sheet in graphite to slip past the other sheets. This slippery-sheet structure is what makes graphite so oily to the touch and makes it such a good material to write with. The carbon sheet fragments readily rub off the pencil core and onto the paper. This property also makes graphite powder an ideal dry lubricant. When a small single graphite sheet is bent into a circle and connected back to itself, it can form a carbon nanotube, which is a promising object that should find application in future technology.;ranch,kept,cap,exist,plural
Edexcel;AS;7707 - Accounting;2018;Aug Sep;"Why is mass conserved in chemical reactions?
";Mass is not conserved in chemical reactions. The fundamental conservation law of the universe is the conservation of mass-energy. This means that the total mass and energy before a reaction in a closed system equals the total mass and energy after the reaction. According to Einstein's famous equation, E = mc2, mass can be transformed into energy and energy can be transformed into mass. This is not some exotic process, but in fact happens every time there is a reaction. Mass is therefore never conserved because a little of it turns into energy (or a little energy turns into mass) in every reaction. ;"But mass+energy is always conserved. Energy cannot be created out of nothing. It can only be created by destroying the appropriate amount of mass according to E = mc2. Between mass and energy, energy is the more fundamental property. In fact, modern physicists just consider mass an alternate form of energy. For this reason, they don't usually call it the ""Law of Conservation of Mass/Energy"" but rather call it the ""Law of Conservation of Energy"" with the implication that this statement includes mass.

In nuclear reactions (changes to the nucleus of atoms), there is enough energy released or absorbed that the change in mass is significant and must be accounted for. In contrast, chemical reactions (changes to only the electrons in atoms) release or absorb very little energy compared to nuclear reactions, so the change in mass of the system is often so small that it can be ignored. As a reasonable approximation only, therefore, chemists often speak of the conservation of mass and use it to balance equations. But strictly speaking, the change in mass of the system during a chemical reaction, though small, is never zero. If the change in mass were exactly zero, there would be no where for the energy to come from. Chemists like to speak of ""chemical potential energy"" and talk as if the energy released in a reaction comes from the potential energy. But ""chemical potential energy"" is just an old-fashioned term for what we now know is mass. Fundamentally, when chemists say ""potential energy"" they mean ""mass"". There is not some bucket of potential energy in an atom from which a reaction can draw. There is just mass.";"The loss (or gain) of mass during all reactions, whether chemical or nuclear, is very well established and has been confirmed experimentally. There are four general types of basic reactions:

The breaking of bonds, which always absorbs energy and increases mass.
The formation of bonds, which always releases energy and decreases mass.
The transformation of existing bonds which is really the excitation of the system to different states (always absorbs energy and increases mass) and de-excitation of the system to different states (always releases energy and decreases mass).
The creation of particles (always absorbs energy and increases mass) and annihilation of particles (always releases energy and decreases mass).
Note that when a chemical reaction absorbs energy, and therefore gains mass, it's not like electrons are created. The extra mass is not caused by the appearance of new particles. Rather, the extra mass is held in the system as a whole. Depending on the position and state of particles in a system relative to each other, the system gains or loses mass in addition to the individual masses of the particles. This concept is very similar to the classical concept of potential energy, but we now know that the energy is actually stored as mass. If you measure with very sensitive equipment the sum of the mass of two million hydrogen atoms and one million oxygen atoms that are separated from each other, then measure the mass of one million water molecules, you will find theses masses to be different.";personal,using,clean,up,again

";"Plastic materials are used in several ways in home construction. Plastic has useful properties such as water resistance, corrosion resistance, electrical insulation, and durability. Here we are using the common meaning of the word ""plastic"": a synthetic moldable solid. Among the uses of plastic in home construction are:";"Sewage pipes. These are increasingly being made out of plastic such as PVC instead of metal because PVC is cheap, corrosive resistant, light, and somewhat flexible.
Water supply lines. These are increasingly being made out of plastic such as PEX because PEX is cheap, strong, and flexible. The relatively high flexibility of PEX leads to better water flow and quicker installation.
Fuel supply lines.
Electrical conduits. These are channels that carry various electrical wires.
Insulating coating on electrical wires.
Housewarp. This is the weather barrier that is placed just behind the exterior siding of a house and serves to keep rain from getting into the house while letting water vapor out.
Thermal insulation.
Roof underlayment.
Electrical boxes and wall plates for light switches and electrical outlets.
Exterior siding. Plastic siding such as vinyl is often shaped to look like wood clapboard or wood shingles.
Kitchen and bathroom flooring. Plastic flooring such as vinyl or Formica can have the look of traditional plastic, or is increasingly being made to look like hardwood or ceramic tile flooring.
Kitchen and bathroom countertops.
Frames for doors and windows.
As a main ingredient in many composite building materials such as Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP).";While plastic is used in various roles in home construction as listed above, it is true that pure plastic is not used for structural components. Pure plastic is not used as the beams, planks, and wall studs that hold up a house for several reasons. First of all, plastic is simply not as strong as wood, metal, or brick. Also, plastic permanently deforms under stress (creeps), and is harder to nail, drill, and screw than wood. Many of these structural limitations can be overcome by mixing plastic with other materials to form composite building materials. If the structural components of your house are made out of composite materials, there is a good chance that a lot of your house is made out of plastic.;independent,double,failed,studied,behavior
Cambridge;O;5054 - Physics;2008;Jan Feb;"Why is propane stored in household tanks but natural gas is not?
";In order to get a useful amount of gaseous fuel into a reasonably-sized tank, you have to liquify it. Some fuels are easier to liquify than others. According to the textbook Organic Chemistry by Joseph M. Hornback, propane has a boiling point of -44Â° F (-42Â° C) at atmospheric pressure, but methane (natural gas), has a boiling point of -260Â° F (-162Â° C) at atmospheric pressure. This means that methane has to be cooled to a much lower temperature than propane in order to be turned to a liquid that can be stored in a tank. Propane molecules consist of three carbon atoms bonded in a chain with eight hydrogen atoms bonded to these carbon atoms.;"In contrast, a methane molecule is just one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Methane molecules have a high degree of symmetry. As a result, they do not have a permanent electric dipole. Bonding between permanent dipoles is the dominant bonding mechanism between molecules as they liquify for many substances such as water. Methane's symmetry, and therefore lack of a permanent electric dipole, means that its molecules can only bond through a much weaker effect known as the London dispersion force or the van der Waals force. In this effect, molecules induce temporary dipoles in each other, and these dipoles then bond. Because this bonding mechanism is so weak, the methane molecules have to be cooled to a low temperature until they are still enough to bond and form a liquid. In contrast, propane does not require as low a temperature to liquify.

But household propane is not usually kept in a liquid state by a low temperature. Instead, high pressure is used. In order to keep propane a liquid at room temperature (70Â° F or 21Â° C), it has to be held in a tank at a pressure of about 850 kPa. This can be accomplished with a strong metal tank. In contrast, to keep methane a liquid at room temperature requires a tank that can maintain a pressure of about 32,000 kPa. Household metal tanks cannot withstand this pressure. In short, methane is not stored in household tanks because the symmetry of its molecule makes it hard to liquify. You could in principle store methane in a tank in the gas state, but methane has such low density in the gas state that you could not store a usable amount. Instead, natural gas is processed and stored at refinery plants and then pumped to households in the gas state through pipes. The properties of different basic fuels are summarized below, showing nicely the trend in room temperature liquid pressures. Note that the pressures are approximate.";"

Cambridge;A;1123 - English Language;2013;Jan Feb;"Are gender traits completely a result of societal expectations?
";No. Gender traits in humans are largely determined by biophysical processes. There seems to be a vocal political faction that is trying to convince people in the name of liberty and equality that gender traits are completely learned, and therefore arbitrary. But this claim disagrees with scientific evidence. In general, boys play more with cars and girls play more with dolls not because their parents are perpetuating outdated gender stereotypes, but because their brain is telling them to. This fact does not mean that boys have to play with boy toys, or that boys who play with dolls aren't really boys. It is just a scientific observation about average behavior and its link to fetal development.;"As most of us learned in school, human males possess XY chromosomes in their DNA code, while females possess XX chromosomes. When a baby is first forming in the womb, its sex chromosomes dictate sexual differentiation between a male and female body. The process is complex and multifaceted, but the main player is a hormone called testosterone. Without testosterone, a baby grows into a girl. With testosterone, a baby grows into a boy. Testosterone dictates the development of male reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone also has an effect on the baby's developing brain. As a result, boys' brains end up larger than girls' brains (this does not mean they are smarter). The testosterone also signals to the brain as it develops in the womb to think like a male. Without the testosterone present, female brains develop more neural interconnections (the white brain matter). That is why females are able to multitask more effectively than men.

The key factors in gender differentiation are testosterone in the brain and the ability of the cells in the brain to react to the testosterone. What happens when testosterone is present in the fetal brain, but the cells are not able to respond to it? This situation is known medically as androgen insensitivity. Interestingly, without testosterone's action being carried out in the brain, the brain grows into a female brain. People with androgen insensitivity have the male genes (XY), but look, feel and think like females. They play more with dolls than cars as infants. The fact that people with androgen insensitivity have male genes but have female gender traits is strong evidence that gender traits are determined by the proper response of fetal brain cells to the presence or absence of testosterone. Most people with androgen insensitivity don't even know they have male genes until medical tests are done because their female brains make them feel so fully female. From a philosophical perspective, the brain dictates a person's identity and traits. Therefore, people with androgen insensitivity can be legitimately called females despite the fact that they have male genes. They are not freaks or mutants, but are full-fledged females, as the ""maleness"" in their DNA never gets activated.

Dr. J. Imperato-McGinley of Cornell University, who is at the forefront of endocrinology research, has published:";"""Gender identity change from female to male has been demonstrated in subjects with 5Î±-reductase-2 deficiency from different areas of the world (see recent review Imperato-McGinley and Zhu, 2002). These subjects demonstrate that exposure of the brain to androgen (testosterone) in utero, during the early postnatal period, and at puberty, appears to have a greater impact in determining male gender identity than does sex of rearing and sociocultural influences. Normally the sex of rearing and androgen exposure of the brain act in concert to determine the male gender. Subjects with 5Î±-reductase-2 deficiency demonstrate that in a laissez-faire environment, when the rearing (female) is discordant with the biological sex; the biologic sex will prevail if normal activation of male puberty is permitted to occur (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1979b and Zhu et al., 1998). Studies of gender in subjects with 5Î±-reductase-2 deficiency underscore the importance of androgens, which act as inducers and activators in evolution of male gender identity in man.""";stairs,of,plan,further,parallel
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2011;Aug Sep;"Are there any parts of the human body that get oxygen directly from the air and not from the blood?
";es. Upper-layer skin cells and the cells in the front surface of the eyes get a significant amount of oxygen directly from the air rather than from the blood. Human bodies have a huge demand for oxygen. As a result, the oxygen that is able to passively diffuse into the body directly from the air is not nearly enough to run the whole body. Fortunately, we have lungs that can actively pull in oxygen and transfer it to the blood, allowing the body to transport oxygen to the cells by using the blood like a fleet of delivery trucks. Most of our cells rely on the blood delivery service. However, the cells in the outer layers or our skin and eyes are in direct contact with the atmosphere and can efficiently get their oxygen right from the air. Let's look at the eyes first.;"For the eyes, it is especially important that there be no blood in the front parts. The parts at the front of the eye need to be transparent in order to let light shine into the eye, thus enabling vision. However, blood is an opaque red color. If blood flowed directly to the front parts of the eye, we would be blinded. As shown in the diagram at the right, the human eye consists of a round, tough white shell called the sclera which envelops a clear gel-like fluid called the vitreous humor. Light travels through the front parts of the eye, through the vitreous humor, and then strikes an array of light-detecting cells on the back of the eye which is called the retina. The front parts of the eye have the job of letting the light inside and focusing the light into images. Therefore, these parts must be transparent (except for the iris and the supporting structures along the edges) and must collectively form a lens shape. The main front parts consist of the lens as well as a lens-shaped pocket of fluid called the aqueous humor and the outer surface which is called the cornea. The cornea is in direct contact with the air. It's job is to contain the aqueous humor and give it a lens-like shape.

The aqueous humor is mostly water and contains very few cells. In contrast, the cornea and lens consist of living cells which must be supplied with oxygen to stay alive. At the same time, they must also stay transparent in order to be able to focus light through. The human body solves this problem in two ways. First, it uses a clear fluid to deliver the oxygen rather than red blood. The aqueous humor itself is the clear fluid that delivers oxygen to the cells in the lens and back side of the cornea. Without red blood cells present to actively clamp on to oxygen molecules and transport them, the aqueous humor must rely on the less-efficient mechanism of simple diffusion to deliver the oxygen. Secondly, our bodies get oxygen into the cells in the front surface of the cornea by simply absorbing it from the air.";"Similarly, the outer layers of the skin absorb oxygen directly from the atmosphere. It's true that the skin does not have to be transparent like the cornea, so it can receive oxygen from the blood, which it indeed does. However, since skin is exposed to the air, it makes sense from an efficiency standpoint that the skin would get its oxygen both from the blood and directly from the air. In fact, according to a study performed by Markus Stucker and his collaborators, as published in The Journal of Physiology, ""the upper skin layers to a depth of 0.25-0.40 mm are almost exclusively supplied by external oxygen, whereas the oxygen transport of the blood has a minor influence."" The amount of oxygen that makes it beyond the skin is negligible, so that most of the cells in our body must get their oxygen from the blood. Interestingly though, the skin itself is able to absorb much of its oxygen directly from the air.";stairs,sister,model,basis,soon
Edexcel;A;3204 - Bengali;2021;Oct Nov;"Are there nuclear reactions going on in our bodies?
";es, there are nuclear reactions constantly occurring in our bodies, but there are very few of them compared to the chemical reactions, and they do not affect our bodies much. All physical objects are made of molecules. A molecule is a series of atoms linked together by chemical (electromagnetic) bonds. Inside each atom is a nucleus which is a collection of protons and neutrons linked together by nuclear bonds. Chemical reactions are the making, breaking, and rearranging of bonds between atoms in molecules. Chemical reactions do not change the nuclear structure of any atoms. In contrast, nuclear reactions involve the transformation of atomic nuclei.;"Most of the processes surrounding us in our daily life are chemical reactions and not nuclear reactions. All of the physical processes that take place to keep a human body running (blood capturing oxygen, sugars being burned, DNA being constructed,etc.) are chemical processes and not nuclear processes. Nuclear reactions do indeed occur in the human body, but the body does not use them. Nuclear reactions can lead to chemical damage, which the body may notice and try to fix.

There are three main types of nuclear reactions:

Nuclear fusion: this is the joining of two small atomic nuclei into one nucleus.
Nuclear fission: this is the splitting of one large atomic nucleus into smaller fragments.
Radioactive decay: this is the change of a less stable nucleus to a more stable nucleus.
Note that nuclear fission and radioactive decay overlap a little bit. Some types of radioactive decay involve the spitting out of nuclear fragments and could therefore be seen as a type of fission. For the purposes of this article, ""fission"" refers to large-scale nucleus fragmentation events that can clearly not be classified as radioactive decay.

Nuclear fusion requires high energy in order to be ignited. For this reason, nuclear fusion only occurs in stars, in supernovas, in nuclear fusion bombs, in nuclear fusion experimental reactors, in cosmic ray impacts, and in particle accelerators. Similarly, nuclear fission requires high energy or a large mass of heavy, radioactive elements. For this reason, significant nuclear fission only occurs in supernovas, in nuclear fission bombs, in nuclear fission reactors, in cosmic ray impacts, in particle accelerators, and in a few natural ore deposits. In contrast, radioactive decay happens automatically to unstable nuclei and is therefore much more common.

Every atom has either a stable nucleus or an unstable nucleus, depending on how big it is and on the ratio of protons to neutrons. Nuclei with too many neutrons, too few neutrons, or that are simply too big are unstable. They eventually transform to a stable form through radioactive decay. Wherever there are atoms with unstable nuclei (radioactive atoms), there are nuclear reactions occurring naturally. The interesting thing is that there are small amounts of radioactive atoms everywhere: in your chair, in the ground, in the food you eat, and yes, in your body.

Radioactive decay produces high-energy radiation that can damage your body. Fortunately, our bodies have mechanisms to clean up the damage caused by radioactivity and high-energy radiation before they become serious. For the average person living a normal life, the amount of radioactivity in his body is so small that the body has no difficulty repairing all the damage. The problem is when the radioactivity levels (the amount of nuclear reactions in and around the body) rise too high and the body cannot keep up with the repairs. In such cases, the victim experiences burns, sickness, cancer, and even death. Exposure to dangerously high levels of radioactivity is rare and is typically avoided through government regulation, training, and education. Common causes of human exposure to high radioactivity include:

Naturally occurring radon in the ground. All forms (isotopes) of the element radon are radioactive. Radon testing in houses has become standard to prevent over-exposure.
Employees working in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons facilities. Strict policies and personal radiation gauges help prevent over-exposure.
People being too close to a nuclear weapon when it is tested.
People living near a nuclear power plant when it experiences a nuclear disaster.
Medical treatment that uses radioactivity in a controlled way to combat disease.
Note that if you have a single medical scan performed that requires drinking or being injected with a radioactive tracer, you do indeed end up with more nuclear reactions in your body than normal, but the level is still low enough to not be dangerous, and therefore was not included on this list.

Low levels of radioactive atoms are constantly accumulating in every person. The ways we end up with radioactive atoms in our bodies include: eating food that naturally contains small amounts of radioactive isotopes, breathing air that naturally contains small amounts of radioactive isotopes, and being bombarded with cosmic rays that create radioactive atoms in our bodies. The most common natural radioactive isotopes in humans are carbon-14 and potassium-40. Chemically, these isotopes behave exactly like stable carbon and potassium. For this reason, the body uses carbon-14 and potassium-40 just like it does normal carbon and potassium; building them into the different parts of the cells, without knowing that they are radioactive. In time, carbon-14 atoms decay to stable nitrogen atoms and potassium-40 atoms decay to stable calcium atoms. Chemicals in the body that relied on having a carbon-14 atom or potassium-40 atom in a certain spot will suddenly have a nitrogen or calcium atom. Such a change damages the chemical. Normally, such change are so rare, that the body can repair the damage or filter away the damaged chemicals. The textbook Chemistry: The Practical Science by Paul B. Kelter, Michael D. Mosher and Andrew Scott states:";"Whereas potassium-39 and potassium-41 possess stable nuclei, potassium-40 is radioactive. This means that when we consume a banana, we get a measurable amount of radioactive potassium-40. How much? The natural abundance of potassium-40 is only 0.012%, or approximately 1 atom in 10,000. A typical banana has approximately 300 mg of potassium. Therefore, with each banana that we eat, we ingest approximately 0.036 mg of radioactive potassium-40.

The natural occurrence of carbon-14 decay in the body is the core principle behind carbon dating. As long as a person is alive and still eating, every carbon-14 atom that decays into a nitrogen atom is replaced on average with a new carbon-14 atom. But once a person dies, he stops replacing the decaying carbon-14 atoms. Slowly the carbon-14 atoms decay to nitrogen without being replaced, so that there is less and less carbon-14 in a dead body. The rate at which carbon-14 decays is constant and well-known, so by measuring the relative amount of carbon-14 in a bone, archeologists can calculate when the person died. All living organisms consume carbon, so carbon dating can be used to date any living organism, and any object made from a living organism. Bones, wood, leather, and even paper can be accurately dated, as long as they first existed within the last 60,000 years. This is all because of the fact that nuclear reactions naturally occur in living organisms.";universe,dropped,failed,shadow,push
Edexcel;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2017;Jan Feb;Can humans ever directly see a photon?;Yes. In fact, photons are the only things that humans can directly see. A photon is a bit of light. Human eyes are specifically designed to detect light. This happens when a photon enters the eye and is absorbed by one of the rod or cone cells that cover the retina on the inner back surface of the eye. When you look at a chair, you are not actually seeing a chair. You are seeing a bunch of photons that have reflected off of the chair. In the process of reflecting off of the chair, these photons have been arranged in a pattern that resembles the chair. When the photons strike your retina, your cone and rod cells detect this pattern and send it to your brain. In this way, your brain thinks it's looking at a chair when it's really looking at a bunch of photons arranged in a chair pattern.;;"Your eyes can see bunches of photons, but can they see a single, isolated photon? Each rod cell in your eye is indeed capable of detecting a single, isolated photon. However, the neural circuitry in your eye only passes a signal along to the brain if several photons are detected at about the same time in neighboring rod cells. Therefore, even though your eye is capable of detecting a single, isolated photon, your brain is not capable of perceiving it. If it could, an isolated photon would just look like a brief flash of brightness at a single point. We know this because a sensitive camera sensor is indeed able to detect and process an isolated photon, and the photon just looks like a brief flash of brightness at a single point.

A photon has several properties, and each of these properties carries information about the source that created the photon or the last object that interacted with the photon. The basic properties of a photon that carry information are color (i.e. frequency), spin (i.e. polarization), location, direction of propagation, and wave phase. There are also many other properties of a photon; such as energy, wavelength, momentum, and wavenumber; but these are all dependent on the frequency and therefore do not carry any extra information. Additionally, when many photons are present, information can be carried by the number of the photons (i.e. brightness). When a group of photons reflects off of a chair, the photons form patterns of color, spin, location, direction, wave phase, and brightness that contains information about the chair. With the proper tools, each of these patterns can be analyzed in order to gain information about the chair. The human eye is designed to detect the color, location, direction, and brightness patterns of a group of photons, but not the spin or wave phase.

Color information is detected in the eye by having three different types of cone cells that each have a different range of color sensitivity. One of the types has a sensitivity range centered on red, another type has a range centered on green, and another type has a range centered on blue. The eye can see almost all of the colors in the visible spectrum by comparing the relative activation of these three different types of cone cells. For instance, when you look at a yellow tulip, yellow photons stream into your eye and hit your red, green, and blue cone cells. Only the red and green cone cells are triggered by the yellow photons, and your brain interprets red plus green as yellow. In contrast to cone cells, there is only one type of rod cell, and so the rod cells can only detect brightness and not color. The rod cells are primarily used in low lighting conditions.

Location information is detected in the eye by having the cone and rod cells spread across different locations along the retina. Different photons existing at different locations will trigger different cells. In this way, the spatial pattern of photon location is directly detected by the retina. Note that photons can come from many different directions and blur together. For this reason, the eye has a stack of lens in the front which focuses only the light to a certain cell which comes from a single point on the object being viewed. The lens plays an essential role in extracting location information about the object being viewed from the location information of the photons on the retina. If the lens malfunctions, photon location on the retina no longer corresponds exactly to point locations on the object being viewed and the image ends up blurry. Note that the human optical system can only directly image two dimensions of the photon location information. Information about the third dimension is indirectly extracted by humans using a variety of visual tricks (called ""depth cues""), the main trick being the use of two eyes that are slightly offset from each other.

Direction information is only crudely detected by humans by having the brain keep track of which way the eyes are pointed, and by having the eyes look at an object from many different angles. For instance, a room with one wall painted red and the opposite wall painted blue has red photons from the wall shooting in one direction and blue photons from the other wall shooting in the opposite direction. At a given spot in the room, the bunch of photons at that spot includes red photons and blue photons traveling in opposite directions. However, a human can only deduce that the red and blue photons are traveling in different directions (and therefore deduce that the red and blue walls are at different locations) by turning his head and analyzing two different views while his brain tracks the orientation of his head.

Brightness information is directly extracted by the retina by measuring how many photons strike a certain region of the retina in a certain time increment. Both the rod cells and the cone cells can collect brightness information.

Since the human eye ultimately only sees photons, a light-generating machine can make a physical object seem to be present by recreating the correct patterns of photons that would come off of the object if it were really present. For instance, we can make it look like a chair is present if we create a collection of photons with the same patterns as the collection of photons that is present when a chair really is there. This is what computer display screens do. A camera captures the patterns in the photons coming from a chair and stores the information as bits of electricity. A computer screen then uses this information to recreate the photon collection and you see a picture of the chair.

However, standard computers screens can only specify the color, brightness, and two-dimensional location of the photons they create. As a result, the image of a physical object on a computer screen is two-dimensional and not completely realistic. There are many tricks that are used to try to convey the third dimension of information to humans, including the polarization glasses used in 3D cinemas and the lenticular lenses used on some book covers. However, such systems are usually not entirely realistic because they do not actually recreate the full three-dimensional photon field. This means that such ""3D"" recreations of objects can only be viewed from one look angle and are not entirely convincing. Some people find that because such ""3D"" systems use visual tricks rather than a full three-dimensional photon field, these systems give them headaches and nausea.

In contrast, a holographic projector comes much closer to recreating the full three-dimensional photon field coming from an object. As a result, a hologram looks much more realistic and can be viewed from many different angles, just like a real object. However, true holograms are currently not able to effectively reproduce color information. Note that many color-accurate images that are claimed to be holograms are actually flat images with tricks added in to make them look somewhat three-dimensional. A fully-realistic photon recreation of a physical object will not be possible until holograms are able to accurately recreate color information.

The two properties of photons that human eyes cannot see are spin (i.e. polarization) and wave phase. Note that under the right conditions some people can detect the overall polarization state of an entire light beam; but no naked human eye can directly see the polarization pattern. By looking through rotatable polarization filters, which convert polarization information to color intensity information, a trained human can learn to indirectly see the polarization pattern of the photons coming from an object. An example of this is the photoelasticity method which allows people to see mechanical stresses in certain objects. In contrast to humans, some animals such as honeybees and octopuses can indeed directly see the polarization pattern of a collection of photons. For instance, honeybees can see the natural polarization pattern that exists in the daytime sky and use it for orientation purposes. Photon wave phase can also not be directly detected by humans but can be detected by machines called interferometers. Phase information is often used to determine the flatness of a reflecting surface.";laid,nuts,clean,room,glass
Cambridge;A;2281 - Economics,;2007;May Jun;"Can I turn my cat into a diamond?
";"Yes. It is scientifically possible to turn your beloved deceased pet or human relative into a diamond that you wear on your finger as a token of remembrance. In fact, there are companies that exist right now that are willing to do this for you. Diamonds that are created from the remains of a loved one are called ""memorial diamonds.""";A diamond is just a collection of carbon atoms arranged in a tightly-packed crystalline pattern. If you press a chunk of carbon, such as graphite or coal, with enough pressure and at high enough temperature, then the carbon atoms are forced into this tightly-packed arrangement. As a result, you make a real diamond. This process is carried out routinely in diamond manufacturing plants. As long as you have a chunk of mostly carbon atoms, you can put it in a diamond press and make a diamond out of it. Your chunk of atoms can even contain some impurities because the diamond pressing process tends to drive out impurities. Diamonds can also be manufactured using chemical vapor deposition. In this process, the carbon atoms are vaporized into the gas state. The carbon atoms, along with some chemicals added to the mix to help along the process, are allowed to drift down and settle on top of each other. If done in a slow, clean, controlled way, the carbon atoms tend to settle into the diamond arrangement. Once the diamond material is created, it still needs to be cut and polished by an expert jeweler in order to give it that distinctive look that we expect.;Just like a chunk of coal, biological tissue can be turned into a diamond. Biological creatures are composed primarily of water and carbon-based molecules. For this reason, the three most abundant elements in biological tissue are hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. If you take your deceased pet or relative and remove all of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, most of the atoms in the remaining tissue will be carbon atoms. With some further filtering, the remains can be reduced down to almost pure carbon. This remaining tissue can therefore be placed in a diamond press and made into a diamond. A few companies have been in the business of turning the remains of beloved pets or relatives into diamonds for several years now. This service could cost you as much as the price of a new car, depending on how big you want the diamond to be.;universe,determine,flat,danger,under
Cambridge;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2008;May Jun;"Do blind people dream in visual images?
";Yes, blind people do indeed dream in visual images. For people who were born with eyesight and then later went blind, it is not surprising that they experience visual sensations while dreaming. Dreams are drawn from memories that are stored in the brain as well as from brain circuitry that is developed while experiencing the outside world. Therefore, even though a person who lost his vision may be currently blind, his brain is still able to draw on the visual memories and on the related brain circuits that were formed before he went blind. For this reason, he can dream in visual images. What is more surprising is the discovery that people who were born blind also dream in visual images.;"The human experience of vision involves three steps: (1) the transformation of a pattern of light to electrical impulses in the eyes, (2) the transmission of these electrical impulses from the eyes to the brain along the optic nerves, and (3) the decoding and assembly of these electrical impulses into visual sensations experienced in the brain. If any one of these three steps is significantly impaired, blindness results. In the vast majority of cases, blindness results from problems in the eyes and in the optic nerves, and not in the brain. In the few cases where blindness results from problems in the brain, the person usually regains some amount of vision due to brain plasticity (i.e. the ability of the brain to rewire itself). Therefore, people who are blind since birth still technically have the ability to experience visual sensations in the brain. They just have nothing sending electrical impulses with visual information to the brain. In other words, they are still capable of having visual experiences. It's just that these experiences cannot originate from the outside world. Dreams are an interesting area, because dreams do not directly originate from the outside world. Therefore, from a plausibility standpoint, it is possible for people blind since birth to dream in visual images. However, just because blind people have the neural capacity to experience visual sensations does not automatically mean that they actually do. Scientists had to carry out research studies in order to determine if people blind since birth actually do dream in visual images.

At this point, you may be wondering, ""Why don't we just ask the people blind since birth if they dream in visual images?"" The problem is that when you ask such people this question, they will always answer no. They are not necessarily answering no because they actually do not have visual dreams. They are saying no because they do not know what visual images are. A girl with eyesight visually recognizes an apple because at some point in the past she saw the apple and ate it, and therefore is able to connect the image of an apple with the taste, small, shape, and touch of an apple. She is also able to connect the image with the word ""apple."" In other words, the visual image of an apple becomes a trigger for all the memories and experiences she has previously had with apples. If a girl has never personally experienced the visual image of an actual apple, then seeing an image on an apple in a dream for the first time has no connection to anything in real world. She would not realize she is seeing an apple. As an analogy, suppose you have never tasted salt. No matter how much people describe salt to you, you do not know what the experience is really like until you experience it personally. Suppose you were all alone and you came across a bag of very salty potato chips in an unlabeled bag. When you eat the chips, you would experience the taste of salt for the first time, but you would not know that that is what you are experiencing, because you would no other previous experiences or connections with it. Similarly, people blind since birth have no experience of connecting visual sensations with external objects in the real world, or relating them to what sighted people describe as vision. Therefore, asking them about it is not useful.

Instead, scientists have performed brain scans of people blind since birth while they are sleeping. What scientists have found is that these people have the same type of vision-related electrical activity in the brain during sleep as people with normal eyesight. Furthermore, people blind since birth move their eyes while asleep in a way that is coordinated with the vision-related electrical activity in the brain, just like people with normal eyesight. Therefore, it is highly likely that people blind since birth do indeed experience visual sensations while sleeping. They just don't know how to describe the sensations or even conceptually connect in any way these sensations with what sighted people describe as vision.

With that said, the brain scans during sleep of people blind since birth are not identical to those of sighted people. While people blind since birth do indeed dream in visual images, they do it less often and less intensely than sighted people. Instead, they dream more often and more intensely in sounds, smells, and touch sensations.";"We should keep in mind that a person blind since birth has never had the experience of seeing images originating from the external world and therefore has never formed visual memories connected to the external world. The visual components of their dreams therefore cannot be formed from visual memories or the associated circuitry. Rather, the visual sensations must arise from the electrical fluctuations that originate within the brain. What this means is that people blind since birth probably do not experience detailed visual images of actual objects such as apples or chairs while dreaming. Rather, they probably see spots or blobs of color floating around or flashing. The spots may even correlate meaningfully to the other senses. For instance, a dream of a police car siren sound traveling from the left to the right may be accompanied by the visual sensation of a spot of color traveling from the left to the right at the same speed. In summary, the current evidence suggests that people blind since birth do indeed dream in images, but we do not know exactly what they see.

On a related note, brain scans have found that all humans dream in visual images before they are born. The darkness of the womb leads to the fact that none of us experienced actual vision before we were born. Therefore a fetus is equivalent in experience to an adult that was blind since birth. For this reason, it should not be surprising that fetuses also dream in visual images.";using,acres,laid,angle,seat
Edexcel;A;2210 - Computer Science;2021;Oct Nov;Do Kirlian photographs show the soul of an organism?;No, Kirlian photographs do not show the soul of an organism. Kirlian photographs show the light that is released by the electrified air surrounding an object when the object is intentionally filled with electricity. Non-scientists and pseudo-scientists claim that the patterns of light captured in Kirlian photography are images of the organism's soul, aura, qi, or metaphysical energy field. However, the truth is much more mundane. When electric charge moves quickly enough through air, it rips electrons off of air molecules and gives them energy.;"When these electrons recombine with the air molecules, they emit their energy in the form of light. For low to medium amounts of electricity, this process is called gas discharge. This is exactly the process at work in neon signs and fluorescent light bulbs. For high amounts of electricity, the physics involved is more violent and the process is called arcing. Examples of arcing include lightning, the sparks created by spark plugs, and the arc created by an arc welder. Lightning bolts, spark plugs, neon signs, and Kirlian photography all share the same root phenomenon: if you run electricity through air quickly enough, the air glows.

Typically, gas discharge is stimulated in tubes containing special gases that are held at low pressures. This increases the efficiency of the process. However, gas discharge happens just fine in regular air at normal pressure. In the open air, gas discharge is called corona discharge. When an object that is sitting in the open air is filled with enough electric charge, the electric charge leaks off of the object into the surrounding air. In doing so, the air surrounding the object becomes electrified and glows. Since the air that is closest to the object is the most electrified, the pattern of light that is present in corona discharge takes on the shape of the object that is being electrically charged.

While corona discharge sounds exotic and looks mystical, it is in reality just as mundane as fluorescent light bulbs and spark plugs. Since corona discharge is a straight-forward electrical effect, the pattern of light that is created depends on the electrical conductivity of the object, the shape of the object, and the composition and state of the air surrounding the object. It does not depend on the biological vitality of the object or the emotional state of the object. All objects, from nails to pennies, can be made to emit a corona discharge. This fact does not indicate that nails have souls. It just indicates that electricity has been pumped into a nail to the point that the surrounding air has become electrified and glows.

Due to the mutual repulsion of electrons, the electrons on an object tend to leak off of sharp, pointy features on the surface of the object, as well as features that are highly conductive. For this reason, the light pattern created by corona discharge tends to be the brightest near the pointy and conductive parts of an object. While this effect can lead to beautiful imagery, it does not indicate that the pointy or electrically conductive parts are in any way more pure, more saintly, or more alive.

Kirlian photography is simply the capture of the light from an object's corona discharge using a photographic plate that is placed very close to the object. Placing the photographic plate very close enables the capturing of fine details in the patterns of the electrified air. Also, by placing the photographic plate very close to the object, some of the electricity leaking off the object directly strikes the plate. These hit points leave marks on the photographic plate in addition to the photographic marks made by the light, increasing the complexity of the final image.";In one stunning experiment, a leaf is placed on a glass plate and then electrified so that its corona discharge is captured on a photographic plate. Then the tip of the leaf is torn off and removed. When the leaf is again electrified and photographed, the resulting corona discharge is found to have the shape of the entire leaf, including the tip that has been removed. This experiment seems to show that the soul of the tip of the leaf is still present, and therefore shows up in the Kirlian photograph, even after the physical tip has been removed. However, this interpretation is false and easily disproven. The corona discharge at the location of the missing leaf tip is caused by leaf moisture residue left on the glass plate. If the glass plate is wiped clean and the ripped leaf is again imaged, the corona discharge no longer appears at the location of the missing tip. Similarly, if the ripped leaf is placed on a new glass plate, there is no corona discharge at the location of the missing leaf tip. This result shows that the famous torn leaf experiment is an example of a poorly run and incorrectly interpreted experiment, rather than an indication that leaves have souls which can be photographed.;touch,seat,freedom,enjoy,giving
Edexcel;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2002;Aug Sep;"Do koalas eat honey like other bears?
";"Despite the fact that the name ""koala bear"" is used in the popular culture of some countries, koalas are actually not bears. The more accurate name of ""koala"" is used in this animal's native land of Australia. Koalas are marsupials, just like kangaroos and possums. Like most other marsupials, koalas give birth to babies that are not fully developed and carry their young around for the first few months in a pouch.

Edexcel;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2010;Jan Feb;"Do poppy seeds contain narcotics?
";"Yes, poppy seeds contain narcotics. Poppy seeds are used to add flavor to many baked goods, salads, and pasta dishes; ranging from lemon bread to chicken salad. Poppy seeds are produced by the opium poppy plant, a plant that has been famous since ancient times for containing psychoactive chemicals. All parts of the opium poppy, including the seeds, contain the drugs morphine and codeine. In fact, eating poppy seeds can lead you to test positive on a drug test. Many government agencies know this fact and therefore discourage people from eating poppy seeds who are required to take drug tests. The official inmate furlough application of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons requires the following pledge:";"It has been determined that consumption of poppy seeds may cause a positive drug test which may result in disciplinary action. As a condition of my participation in community programs, I will not consume any poppy seeds or items containing poppy seeds.

Morphine acts directly on the central nervous system by binding and activating the Î¼-opioid receptors, chiefly causing relief of intense pain and sleepiness. In high doses and/or extended use, morphine can also cause euphoria, physical addiction, and suppressed breathing. Although morphine plays an important role in medical settings, it can be abused because of its euphoric and addictive properties.

So why don't poppy seeds give you a drug-induced high if they contain narcotics? The answer is that the concentration of narcotics in poppy seeds is too low. A study performed by M. Thevis, G. Opfermann, and W Schanzer, and published in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology, found that commercially-available poppy seeds contain between 0.5 and 10 micrograms of morphine per gram of seeds. A typical poppy-seed food contains only a few grams of poppy seed, and therefore only a few micrograms of morphine. In contrast, a single initial dose of medically-prescribed morphine contains between 5,000 and 30,000 micrograms. Therefore, a person with no morphine tolerance would need to eat between 500 and 60,000 grams of poppy seeds in one sitting in order to get enough morphine to have a noticeable drug effect. This is equivalent to 1 to 130 pounds. The exact amount depends on the potency of the poppy seeds and the person's sensitivity. While eating several pounds of poppy seeds in one sitting is certainly doable, it is highly unusual. If you had a particularly potent batch of poppy seeds, and if you were particularly sensitive to morphine, and if you really liked poppy-seed cake to the point of eating pounds of it, then unintentionally ingesting medicinal levels of morphine is entirely possible. But for the rest of us, a sprinkling of poppy seeds on our bagels may give us just barely enough morphine to fail a drug test, but not enough to do much else. This does not mean that poppy seeds are completely harmless. If you make a tea using pounds of poppy seeds, you can indeed concetrate the narcotics enough to give you a high and enough to harm you. Sadly, there have been cases of people dying from a narcotics overdose brought about by drinking poppy seed tea.";The bottom line is: if you are worried about drug effects, don't eat poppy seeds by the pound or drink poppy seed tea. If you want to pass a drug test, don't eat or drink any at all.;driven,bell,not,iron,should
Cambridge;A;2210 - Computer Science;2014;Jan Feb;"Does the human body contain minerals?
";For the most part, the human body does not contain minerals. Scientifically speaking, a mineral is a naturally-occurring inorganic crystalline solid with a single chemical formula. Rocks are aggregates of minerals and organic materials. Except for in bones and teeth, the atoms and molecules making up a healthy body are not crystalline and are not solid. In this way, most of the molecules making up a human body fail to meet the definition of a mineral.;"Confusion often arises because many health professionals, nutritionists, and biologists misuse the word ""mineral"". When they say ""mineral"" in the context of human nutrition, they really mean ""dietary element"". Scientifically, the phrase ""trace element"" should really be used instead of ""trace mineral"" when talking about rare atoms required by the human body. The words ""element"" and ""mineral"" do not mean the same thing. A chemical ""element"" is a material containing only one kind of atom. In some cases, elements can form minerals, but they don't have to. For example, hydrogen is an element, but it is not a mineral because it is neither crystalline nor a solid. In contrast, quartz is indeed a mineral, but it is not an element because it contains more than one kind of atom. A gold nugget found in the ground is both an element (because it contains only gold atoms) and a mineral (because it has a natural crystalline solid structure). The small subset of materials in the world that contain only one kind of atom and have the atoms naturally bonded into a solid crystalline lattice are called ""native element minerals"".

The Dictionary of Chemistry by N. Pradeep Sharma states under the entry titled mineral, ""A naturally occurring substance that has a characteristic chemical composition and, in general, a crystalline structure is known as mineral."" Under the entry titled element, this dictionary states, ""A pure substance which cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical means...All elements have a unique number of protons in thier atoms."" Listed below are some examples to illustrate the difference between these terms.
1. Materials that are elements, but not minerals

helium (He)
oxygen (O)
fluorine (F)
mercury (Hg)
sodium vapor (Na), such as in lamps
molten iron (Fe)
amorphous carbon (C)
any single atom by itself can be called an element
2. Materials that are minerals, but not elements

table salt (NaCl)
quartz (SiO2)
calcite (CaCO3)
hematite (Fe2O3)
ice (H20)
3. Materials that are both minerals and elements (native element minerals):

gold (Au)
copper (Cu)
silver (Ag)
iron (Fe)
diamond (C)
For example, table salt contains sodium atoms and chlorine atoms bound into a solid, ionic, cubic crystalline lattice. Naturally occurring salt is therefore a mineral. But as soon as you sprinkle salt on your tongue and begin to eat it, the salt dissolves in the water on your tongue. This means that the sodium and chlorine atoms break apart and float around in the water. You no longer have a mineral. You have elemental ions in solution. Your body then uses the dissolved elemental sodium ions to regulate fluid pressure levels and to send electrical signals along your nerves. In this way, you can eat minerals, but once you eat them, they aren't minerals anymore. Furthermore, you can get dietary elements from non-mineral sources. For example, you can get dietary sodium from milk, which is not a mineral. In fact, we get most of our dietary elements from non-mineral sources. The only mineral we really eat on a regular basis is table salt.";"The one exception in a healthy human is bone mineral, such as in bones and teeth. Bone mineral is indeed an inorganic, crystalline, solid with a single chemical formula and therefore qualifies as a genuine mineral. The mineral in your bones is called hydroxyapatite and has the chemical formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH). Our bodies build bone mineral on the spot, so we don't have to swallow hydroxyapatite crystals. But we do have to eat food with enough of the right kinds of atoms to build bone mineral. Looking at the chemical formula, we see that our bodies can't build bone mineral unless we supply it with enough calcium, phosphorus, oxygen, and hydrogen. A typical person has almost unlimited access to hydrogen and oxygen atoms through the water he drinks and the air he breaths. In contrast, a person can only get enough calcium and phosphorus to build healthy bones if he eats and drinks foods containing these elements.

Minerals can also form in the human body as part of disease states such as in kidney stones.";dawn,not,them,brought,free
Edexcel;A;7707 - Accounting;2014;May Jun;How can the heart be strong enough to pump blood up your legs against gravity?;The heart is not strong enough by itself to get the blood back up the veins in your legs and back to your heart. The human body relies on a second system to finish that task. This system involves small valves throughout the veins and muscle contractions from your skeletal muscles when you walk and move about.;"The valves close when blood starts to flow in one direction, so that blood in the veins can only flow in the direction back to the heart, which is up the legs. When you squeeze your leg muscles to walk, stand, kick, and move about, the muscles squeeze the veins and force the blood to get moving. Because of the valves, the blood can only move in one direction as it gets squeezed along. So it is a combination of blood pressure from the heart's pumping action, the valves, and muscle movement that gets the blood up the legs against gravity. If the valves malfunction, then the blood falls back down to some extent after every muscle contraction and begins to pool in the veins. This causes the veins to swell with blood, which can be painful and unsightly, and is known as varicose veins.

The book Varicose Veins and Related Disorders by David J. Tibbs states:";"Gravity is an ever-present force against which the limb's venous system is designed to compete in the upright position. If the valves fail, it is gravity that causes any blood that has been shifted upwards to fall back again and this has various effects. In the superficial veins it may cause visible tortuosity (varicose veins) but, much more damaging, the reflux of blood through superficial or deep veins may cause the rapid build up of an uninterrupted column of blood to the heart with consequent high venous pressure at the ankle... Only the peripheral pumping mechanism (musculovenous pumping) can cause full venous flow against gravity. This forceful pumping action is brought about when multiple veins are compressed by contraction of surrounding skeletal muscle (Figure 1.3). The valves direct the blood heartwards and prevent it from falling back again. Thus, by this simple arrangment, the harder the muscles work, the more vigorously is the massive flow of blood generated by this activity returned towards the heart.

Put simply, if you want to literally get the blood flowing in your legs, walk around and get your leg muscles moving.";kept,flat,behavior,gently,not
Edexcel;A;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2008;May Jun;"How can we differentiate so many different foods if we can only taste four flavors on our tongue: sweet, bitter, sour, and salty?
";"Humans can taste more than four flavors on their tongue. Depending on how narrowly you define ""taste"", there are between five and several dozen independently experienced sensations on the tongue, according to the book ""Taste and Smell: An Update"" by Thomas Hummel. The seven most common flavors in food that are directly detected by the tongue are: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, meaty (umami), cool, and hot.";"Note that ""cool"" and ""hot"" tastes do not refer to actual low or high temperatures being present, but rather to foods that chemically trigger a sensation that is similar to cool or hot sensations. Sweet flavors come from things like candy and fruits. Bitter flavors come from many vegetables and unsweetened chocolate. Sour flavors are contained in anything with acid, such as citrus fruits or vinegar. Salty flavors obviously come from anything with salt, such as chips or nuts. Meaty flavors come from anything with glutamates such as soy sauce, cheese, and meat. Cool flavors come from certain chemicals such as in mint and menthol. Hot flavors come from other chemicals such as in chili peppers and black peppers. Beyond these seven basic tastes, there are several other flavors that researchers have found receptors for, including calcium, dryness, fattiness, heartiness, and numbness.";But returning back to the original question, it is true that humans experience far more flavors than the tongue can detect. The reason for this is that the nose plays an integral part in the experience of taste, and the nose can detect thousands of different smells.;bell,west,basis,personal,liquid
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2015;Aug Sep;"How can we unlock the 90% of our brain that we never use?
";Healthy humans use all of their brain. There is no part of the brain that goes unused. Certain tasks work certain parts of the brain more, but they all play important roles, as explained by neurobiologist Dr. Eric Chudler. Brain maps, as found in modern anatomy books, indicate that each part of the brain has a specific function essential to a healthy human. If there were a part of your brain that really went unused, then you could safely damage that part in an accident with no ill effects.;"But decades of medical records show that damage to any part of the brain has severe effects. If 90% of the brain were not used, then 90% of the brain tumors would cause no problem. Imagine brain doctors telling 90% of their cancer patients, ""I have good news and bad news. Bad news: you have a brain tumor. Good news: it's in the part of the brain that you will never use."" The thought is absurd.

If the 10% myth is instead supposed to mean that humans only use 10% of their brain in a given moment, it is still false. The brain is not a collection of independent machines that are turned on or off depending on whether you are reading or singing. Rather, brain functions emerge as a complex interplay of many parts of the brain. Physiologically, nerves are like muscles in that they degenerate when unused. If 90% of the brain went completely unused, then that portion would degenerate significantly.";But brain scans of a healthy person reveals all parts to be intact. This myth was propagated by authors trying to sell books on mystical ways to unlock your hidden potential, claiming that unused brain power could be tapped using the methods in their books. The greatest danger to your brain is not the possibility that a large portion is going on unused. Rather, the greatest dangers are stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and tumors. The best ways to protect yourself from such risks include eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough rest. Do you really want to use your brain to its full potential? Then put down your unlocking-hidden-brain-potential book and go on a run.;bend,sitting,determine,them,valley
Edexcel;A;7010 - Computer Studies;2005;Aug Sep;"How did doctors create my belly button?
";Doctors did not create your belly button (or navel). The navel is not the scar or knot left by a doctor that cut your umbilical cord at birth. This fact is obvious to anyone that has ever had children or bathed newborns, but it is sometimes misunderstood by others. While you were in your mother's womb, your umbilical cord attached to your navel at one end and to your placenta at the other end. ;"The placenta is a pancake-shaped mass of blood vessels that attaches to the wall of the mother's uterus. Food that your mother ate and oxygen that she breathed went into her blood, and then was carried to her uterus. Where your placenta and your mother's uterus touched, the food and oxygen was exchanged from your mother's blood to your blood. Your blood than carried the nutrients from the placenta, down the umbilical cord, through your navel, and into your body.

Once you were born, you no longer needed to get food and oxygen through your navel, as you could now get them through your mouth. As a result, the umbilical cord was no longer needed and your body had a natural way of getting rid of the cord. On its own, your body closed up the point where the umbilical cord joined your body and formed your belly button. When the doctor or midwife that assisted during your birth cut your umbilical cord, he or she cut it several millimeters away from the end of the cord, leaving a piece of the cord still hanging off your belly. He or she did this to let the body form a well-shaped belly button on its own. The remaining peice of umbilical cord is called a stump. A few days to weeks after your birth, when your body had formed a properly closed bell button, the stump fell off naturally like a scab falling off of a healed wound (assuming you did not have abnormalities at birth). The Mayo Clinic Guide to Your Baby's First Year states,";After your newborn's umbilical cord is cut, all that remains is a small stump. In most cases, the remaining cord will dry up and fall off one to three weeks after birth. Until then, you want to keep the area as clean and dry as possible. It's a good idea to give sponge baths rather than full baths until the cord falls off and the navel area heals...Exposing the cord to air and allowing it to dry at its base will hasten its separation. To prevent irritation and keep the navel area dry, fold the baby's diaper below the stump. In warm weather, dress a newborn in just a diaper and T-shirt to let air circulate and help the drying process.;tightly,actual,properly,enjoy,lead
Cambridge;A;5054 - Physics;2004;Aug Sep;"How did evolution ever lead ostriches to hide their head in the sand when an enemy approaches?
";"Ostriches never hide their head in the sand, especially not when approached by an enemy. In fact, ostriches can become quite aggressive when threatened. According to the book ""Flightless Birds"" by Clive Roots, ostriches respond to predators by either running away or attacking. Ostriches have very powerful legs and have been known to kill people with a slashing kick. When fleeing danger, ostriches can reach 50 mph and can sustain a speed of 30 mph for a half hour. This myth perhaps comes from the fact that ostriches have long necks and small heads so that when they are bending over to swallow sand, it looks like their head is buried. But harboring the notion that ostriches are dumb and harmless can be a deadly mistake for humans to make.";;;were,energy,parallel,human,coast
Edexcel;O;2210 - Computer Science;2018;Aug Sep;"How do I turn on more parts of my brain and get smarter?
";"Turning on more parts of your brain does not make you smarter. The brain does not really work that way. An example of a brain experiencing high activation is a seizure. During a seizure, a person has severely decreased functioning and mental capability. A person having a seizure can't talk, can't walk, and can't do math problems. This extreme example should make clear that ""turning on more of the brain"" does not equal ""smarter"".";"The brain contains a complex network of neurons that includes many feedback loops. Thoughts, memories, and calculations in the brain are emergent phenomena that arise out of the interplay of many neurons. A new idea is not stored in a single neuron. Rather, an idea is stored in the way many neurons are connected together. More specifically, an idea is stored in the way a brain signal travels through these connections in a cascading, looping, non-linear fashion. The analogy that the brain works like a computer is completely wrong. Standard microchip computers are deterministic, linear, and have localized processing operations. This type of processing is excellent for doing long mathematical calculations and carrying out deterministic actions such as displaying photos or editing text documents. However, this type of processing is terrible at generating creativity, recognizing patterns in complex systems, attaching value to information, extrapolating complex trends, learning new skills, and generalizing data into a small set of principles. In contrast to computers, the brain is non-deterministic, asynchronous, non-linear, and has delocalized processing operations. In this way, the brain is really the opposite of a traditional microchip computer; it is good at generating creativity, recognizing patterns, evaluating information, extrapolating trends, learning new skills, and generalizing data; but it is bad at doing long numerical calculations. Since a computer is linear and deterministic, you can make it more powerful simply by installing more processor cores and more RAM. In contrast, the brain is non-linear and non-deterministic, so turning on more neurons at once won't make the brain smarter.

These comments lead to the question, ""How does a person get smart?"" My response is, ""What do you mean by smart?"" I do not give this response to be evasive. My response gets at the core of how a brain works. Strictly speaking, your brain is always getting smart in some way, whether you are working at it or not (assuming your brain is generally healthy). Your brain is always processing the external world, finding patterns, forming memories, and learning information. From a neurological perspective, skipping your math homework and watching cartoons instead does not make your brain any less smart. It just makes your brain good at reciting cartoon theme songs instead of being good at solving math problems. If your job is to recite cartoon theme songs on stage, then watching cartoons will make you smarter than completing your math homework will. With this in mind, ""smart"" does not really mean using your brain more. Assuming you are generally healthy, you always use the optimal amount of brain power whether you try to or not. ""Smart"" means using your brain to learn the information and skills that are important to you.

The fields of mathematics, science, language, and history all contain facts, concepts, and skills that pertain to the real world. These concepts and skills either exist in the real world, are applicable to the real word, or are useful in carrying out professions in the real world. For these reasons, the learning of concepts and skills in mathematics, science, language, and history has become culturally associated with being smart. But a person who drops out of school and spends all of his time enjoying video games, television, movies, and fantasy books is still smart in the neurological sense of learning things and filling his brain with information. He is just smart in areas that are mostly useless, non-productive, and non-employable. Note that making a video game is entirely different from playing a video game. Memorizing where all the treasures are hidden in your favorite video game does not make you more able to get a job designing games. It takes mathematics, language, art, and programming skills to build virtual worlds. That is what I mean when I say that the knowledge and skills gained by playing video games are mostly useless, non-productive, and non-employable.

In short, the way to get smart is to decide what field is important to you, and then spend a lot of time working and learning in that field. If you want to get good at math, do math problems again and again. Furthermore, you have to put in the work to make sure you learn to do the math problems correctly. If you want to get good at playing the violin, practice every day. There is no magical way to learn a subject without putting in the hard work and time.";"With that said, there are more effective ways of learning a subject than others. As mentioned previously, the human brain is constructed so that it is good at recognizing and learning patterns. Therefore, you will learn a subject more quickly if you first learn the rules, and then connect the information into patterns using the rules as you go. For instance, learning how to read by going through a list of 5000 of the most common words and simply memorizing the sound of each word is slow and tedious. In contrast, mastering a few dozen phonics rules is much more effective. As another example, memorizing a list of battle names and dates in a particular war is less productive. In contrast, it is more effective to first learn about war heroes, weapons technology, basic geography, and the war strategies that were used; and then connect the names and dates of the battles to these concepts. Creating maps, charts, timelines, and biographies is far more effective for learning history than memorizing unconnected list of facts because the human brain is optimized for seeing and learning patterns.";properly,danger,product,word,clean
Edexcel;A;3204 - Bengali;2002;Oct Nov;"How do nerves control every organ and function in the body?
";"Nerves do not control every tissue and function in the human body, although they do play a large role. There are three main ways that bodily organs and functions are controlled:

Through the central nervous system
Through the endocrine system
Through local self-regulation (which includes intracrine, autocrine, paracrine, and immune regulation)";"Nerves carry orders from the brain and spinal cord in the form of electrical signals. Nerves also help sense the state of tissues and relay this information back to the brain and spinal cord, enabling us to experience pain, pleasure, temperature, vision, hearing, and other senses. The body uses electrical signals sent along nerves to control many functions because electrical signals can travel very quickly. At the end of each nerve's axon terminals the electrical signals are converted to chemical signals which then trigger the appropriate response in the target tissue. However, the control exerted by the nervous system inevitably resides in the brain and spinal cord, an not in the nerves, which just pass along the signals. Most signals get processed in the brain, but high-risk signals are processed and responded to by the spinal cord before reaching the brain in the effect we call ""reflexes"". Although the central nervous system plays a large role in controlling the body, it is not the only system that exerts control.

thyroid hormone T3 molecule
The molecular structure of thyroid hormone (T3), which regulates the rate of energy use in the body. Public Domain Image, source: Wikipedia.
The endocrine system is a series of endocrine glands throughout the body that excrete certain chemical signals called hormones into the blood stream. The circulating blood then takes the hormones throughout the entire body where different tissues respond in characteristic ways to the hormones. The response of an organ or system to a hormone depends on how much of that hormone is present in the blood. In this way, endocrine glands can exert control over different organs and functions of the body by varying how much hormone they emit. In contrast to the central nervous system, the pathway of control for the endocrine system is purely chemical and not electrical. For example, the thyroid gland in the neck controls how quickly the body uses energy by secreting varying levels of thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid hormone, and you become restless, jittery, and unable to sleep. Too little thyroid hormone and you become sleepy, lethargic, and enable to think straight. A healthy body constantly monitors the activity level and adjusts the thyroid hormone levels as needed.

Other examples of endocrine glands are the adrenal glands, which prepare the body for facing an emergency, and the reproductive glands, which control body mass and reproduction. Hormones in the body control functions as diverse as libido, fertility, menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy, child birth, lactation, sleep, blood volume, blood pressure, blood sugar, the immune system, vertical growth in children, muscle mass, wound healing, mineral levels, appetite, and digestion. Ultimately, much of the endocrine system is subservient to the brain via the hypothalamus, but the endocrine system does operate somewhat independently using feedback loops.

Lastly, organs and functions in the body are controlled through local self-regulation. Rather than depend on the brain to dictate every single minute task, organs and cells can accomplish a lot on their own so that the brain is freed up for more important tasks. An organ can communicate regulatory signals through its interior using localized chemical signals such as paracrine hormone signalling. Typically, such hormones do not enter the blood stream, but are transported locally by simply flowing in the space between cells. This approach works because paracrine hormones are only meant to operate on nearby cells. For example, the clotting of blood and healing of wounds are controlled locally through an exchange of paracrine hormones. The organ with the highest degree of self-regulation is probably the liver. The liver hums along nicely, performing hundreds of functions at once without much direction from the rest of the body. An organ can also communicate through its interior electrochemically. For instance, the heart does not beat because a nerve is telling it to. The heart beats on its own through a cyclic wave of electrical impulses. While it is true that the brain can tell the heart to speed up or slow down, the actual beating of the heart is controlled locally.";"Also, each cell of the body has some degree of self-regulation internal to the cell itself. Some cells exert more internal control than others. For instance, white blood cells hunt down and destroy germs in a very independent fashion, as if they were autonomous organisms. Active white blood cells do not wait for the brain or a hormone to tell them to do their job. Sperm cells are so autonomous that they can continue to survive and function properly even after completely leaving the male's body.

In reality, the central nervous system, the endocrine system, and the local regulation systems are not independent, but exert control over each other in a complicated manner.";bend,brick,riding,them,hot
Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2008;Aug Sep;"How do trees give earth all its oxygen?
";All of earth's oxygen does not come from trees. Rather, the atmospheric oxygen that we depend on as humans comes predominantly from the ocean. According to National Geographic, about 70% of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from marine plants and plant-like organisms. These ocean-living plants release molecular oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis (as do most plants). In photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight and use its energy to split carbon dioxide and water, making sugar for itself and releasing oxygen as a by-product. The dominance of ocean life as earth's top oxygen producer makes sense when you consider that the majority of the earth is covered with ocean.;Of the different types of marine life providing oxygen, the dominant class is phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are microscopic photosynthesizing organisms that live in water. Phytoplankton includes cyanobacteria, green algae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates. Although too small to be visible to the human eye by itself, when many phytoplankton clump together they look like green ocean slime. The oxygen we depend on from breath to breath is provided mostly by a vast army of invisible sea creatures.;This image shows global chlorophyll levels averaged from 1997-2006.

Edexcel;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2016;May Jun;How does the outer layer of skin cells on my finger detect when I am touching an object?;The outer layer of skin cells on your finger does not detect anything. The outer layer of your skin contains cells that are dead. In fact, the outermost 25 to 30 cell layers of your skin consist of dead cells that do nothing beyond providing a physical barrier that keeps water in and chemicals out. Furthermore, all regular skin cells (keratinocytes), whether alive or dead, don't detect physical sensations since they are not designed to do this. Physical sensations that are experienced when touching an object are detected by special receptors that sit in lower layers of the skin.;"Such sensations include pressure, temperature, vibration, and skin stretching. Therefore, in order for you to detect a physical effect, it must first pass through all the layers of dead skin. For instance, in order for you to feel that a frying pan is hot, heat from the pan must travel through the outer layers of dead skin before it can reach the thermoreceptors nestled in the lower layers of the skin. The thermoreceptors then detect the heat and in response send an electrical signal along your nerves to your brain.

If you lightly, directly touch a solid object that is at the same temperature as your finger, the physical sensation that you detect is pressure. It is therefore the sensation of pressure that lets you feel the presence of the object. For instance, close your eyes and slowly move your finger towards the wall. At some point, you can feel that your finger tip is touching the wall. But how exactly does it do this?";When your finger gets very close to the wall, the atoms that make up the outermost skin cells of your finger start to significantly overlap with the atoms of the wall. When this starts happening, the Pauli exclusion principle of quantum theory (which states that no two electrons can be in the exact same state at the same place at the same time) leads to a repulsive electromagnetic force. This repulsive force pushes back on the atoms that make up the outer layer of your skin. This repulsive force is strong enough that it halts the forward movement of the outer layer of skin. This layer therefore gets in the way of the lower layers of skin that are still trying to move towards the wall along with the rest of your hand. In this way, pressure is transmitted through the outer dead layers of skin cells to the inner layers where the pressure can be detected. As long as you are using your muscles to push your finger toward the wall and as long as the wall is pushing back without breaking, all the layers of skin on the tip of your finger are sandwiched between these two forces and continue to experience increased pressure. Therefore, certain nerve endings in your skin called mechanoreceptors will continue to detect the pressure and continue to send the corresponding signals to your brain, creating the ongoing perception of touching the wall.;parallel,iron,trap,teach,brought
Cambridge;A;4024 - Mathematics D;2004;May Jun;"How long before genetic sequencing is able to tell us exactly how our children will look and act?
";Genetic sequencing will never be able to perfectly predict an organism's appearance and behavior for the simple reason that genes are not the only thing that determine biology. There are three basic factors that determine the nature of an organism: 1) genetics, 2) unconscious environmental factors, 3) learned and conscious behavior. Your genes only directly determine basic biological properties such as the number of eyes, the shape of bones, and gender. Your genes do not determine exactly where every mole will grow, how obese you will be, or which baseball team you will route for.;"The textbook Developmental Biology by Russ Hodge states, ""Development is constantly influenced by subtle events in the environment, and many of an organism's features are not determined by genes. For example, every human embryo is programmed to develop fingerprints, but the precise patterns they form are determined by tiny, random events that vary from individual to individual.""

Unconscious environmental factors affected who you are even before you were born. Many birth defects are caused by the exposure of the fetus to a harmful substance or by the pregnant mother providing insufficient vitamins. A damaging blow to a boy's gonads can, if untreated, reduce the levels of testosterone and thereby drastically influence the boy's physical appearance upon hitting puberty. Beyond the influence of nutrient levels and exposure to chemicals, the simple randomness of life affects your biological make-up. Identical twins have almost the exact same set of genes, but they don't have every hair in identically the same place. While genes dictate that there is (or is not) hair on your head, they do not dictate the exact location of every hair. Rather, the complex, random nature of chemistry plays a role. As a metaphor, consider the case where two identical cups of water are poured in exactly the same way onto two identical floors. While the average shape, depth, and size of the resulting puddles will match well, microscopic features of the puddles will be quite distinct. The individual molecules of both puddles will definitely not be in the exact same locations. Aside from physical environmental factors, unconscious psychological factors also play a role. A girl that grew up around pet snakes will most likely not shriek in terror as an adult at the sight of a snake.

Learned and conscious behavior also play a large role in who you are. Children grow up to speak very much like their parents. A boy who has a father that loves baseball and engages him in the sport will likely grow up to do the same with his child. While innate programming does tend to lead boys to plays with cars and girls to play with dolls, some of the child's gender behavior is learned from the prevailing cultural norms. Parents, teachers, friends, extracurricular activities, religious routines, books, and movies all play a role in shaping us. The act of learning not only affects your mind and emotions, but can also influence your body. For instance, a girl who does gymnastics has a more developed upper-body muscle structure than other girls her age. An avid guitar player develops finger calluses. Furthermore, humans are not robots that are programmed by genes and parents. Rather, as conscious, intelligent creatures, you also behave certain ways because you want to, despite the influence of your genes and your environment. For instance, alcoholism is often passed down continually through a family's generations because of its strong genetic and environmental links. But some children born into such a family line grow up and decide to break the generational cycle of alcoholism. They use their conscious choice to fight against their inherited and acquired alcoholic tendencies because they are aware of the harm it causes. Conscious choice opens the door for a person to learn new behavior patterns despite their genes and environment. Parents of identical twins discover that the twins develop different personalities, mannerisms, interests and hobbies after years of different conscious choices.

Even if your genes were the only thing that determined your appearance and personality, there would still be variability between people with identical genes. The reason for this is that your genes do not determine your biology in a strictly linear, forward fashion. Your body is not built as an exact replica of a blueprint contained in our DNA. Human biology is both a coded pattern and an emergent phenomenon. If you drop a number of identical balls through a grid of pegs known as a Galton box, a bell curve results. The bell curve is a purely emergent phenomenon, meaning that each ball does not contain a map of the final bell curve. The bell curve emerges after each ball interacts with the pegs. In a similar way, your genes only determine who you are in so far as their information is modified by the process known as gene expression. The gene expression process involves many steps, and there are feedback loops among these steps. This means that external factors can modulate how your genes get expressed. A journal article titled ""RNA regulation of epigenetic processes"" by J.S. Mattick and collaborators states, ""It is also evident that RNA editing is a primary means by which hardwired genetic information in animals can be altered by environmental signals"". In an extreme example of genetic expression, if a person's cells are insensitive to sex hormones, a person with male DNA (XY in every cell) can end up looking and feeling like a woman, a condition known as androgen insensitivity. Because of the effects of unconscious environmental factors, learning, free choice, and non-linear gene expression; genetic sequencing will never be able to completely predict a child's appearance and behavior.";"One other item worth noting is that ""genetic sequencing"" is not the same as ""gene decoding"". Sequencing simply records the positions of the atoms along the length of the DNA but does not derive meaning from the sequence. The genes still have to be decoded in order to understand the effect of each gene. The complex decoding process is being carried out by a large field of biologists and is currently incomplete. The situation is like discovering a recipe for ancient Egyptian bread carved into the walls of a recently unearthed tomb, and the recipe is in an unknown script. Just because you have copied down the figures on the wall into your notebook does not mean that you have any idea how to read the recipe, let alone properly bake Egyptian bread according to the recipe. Complete sequencing of the human genome has been accomplished. Complete decoding has not.";standard,sister,except,seat,browserling

";"First of all, it is impossible to see anything at all in total darkness. Total darkness means the absence of light, and our eyes depend on light to see. With that said, it is quite rare to be in a situation with total darkness, even at night. City lights reflecting off of clouds, car headlamps, the moon, the stars, and even the airglow of the night sky itself all fill the night with faint light. Most of our experiences with darkness are actually cases of partial darkness; where there is still a small amount of light present. With enough time, our eyes can adapt and see the low levels of light present in partial darkness.";"Human eyes take several hours to fully adapt to darkness and reach their optimal sensitivity to low light conditions. The quickest gains in vision sensitivity are made in the first few minutes after exposure to darkness. For this reason, many people think that after only a few minutes, their eyes have reached their peak sensitivity. But several hours into darkness exposure, the human eyes continue to adapt and make small gains in sensitivity.

Typical sensitivity of human eyes as they adapt to darkness. The cone cells adapt within 10 minutes but then are overtaken in performance by the rod cells. The rod cells can take several hours to become completely dark adapted and reach their peak sensitivity to low light conditions. Note that this plot is only representative of the general trends. The actual curve varies from person to person, from one spot on the eye to the next, and from one day to the next. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
There are several factors that contribute to our eyes adapting to darkness. As described in the textbook Optometry: Science Techniques and Clinical Management, edited by Mark Rosenfield and Nicola Logan, the three main players in dark adaptation are the pupil, the cone cells, and the rod cells.

The pupil is the dark hole near the front of your eye that lets the light into your eye so that the light can form an image on the back (the retina). The iris that surrounds the pupil contains muscles that control the size of the pupil. When confronted with low light conditions, the iris expands the pupil as wide as possible. This dilation lets as much light as possible into the eye so that sensitivity is enhanced. The pupil's contribution to dark adaptation takes only a few seconds to a minute to be completed.

The cones cells along the retina are responsible for color vision. Similar to a grid of pixels in a digital camera, a vast spatial array of cone cells along the retina detect the different bits of colored light that make up the image we are seeing. Human eyes have red-, green-, and blue-detecting cone cells. All other colors that exist are experienced by humans as a mixture of red, green and blue. The cone cells themselves can adapt to partial darkness. Cone cells contain rhodopsin, which is one of many light-sensitive chemicals. Rhodopsin is very sensitive to light and is the primary chemical used by the cones when seeing in low light conditions. The problem is that rhodopsin is so sensitive to light that under normal light levels, the light deforms and deactivates (photobleaches) this chemical. Most of the day, when we are walking around in normal light, the rhodopsin in our eyes is deactivated. Upon exposure to darkness, the rhodopsin is able to regenerate and reactivate, becoming sensitive again to light and improving our night vision. But this regeneration process takes time. Cone cells take about 10 minutes to adapt to the dark.";"Lastly, the rod cells in our eyes are responsible for black and white vision. They are the heavy-hitters when it comes to vision in low light conditions. The rods in our eyes achieve this great night vision through several mechanisms:

Like cones, rod cells contain rhodopsin, the chemical that is highly sensitive to light. In fact, rod cells rely more heavily on rhodopsin than cone cells, leading each single rod cell to be about 100 to 1000 times as sensitive as a single cone cell once fully adapted.
There are far more rods on the retina (100 million) than there are cones (5 million).
Several rods all connect to the same output signal (the same interneuron). This fact allows lower levels of light to be detected at the cost of image resolution.
Rods respond slowly to light (they collect light over long time periods). This slow response means that lower levels of light can be detected at the cost of sensing rapid changes in time.
Cone cells take several hours to become completely dark adapted. Expert naked-eye astronomers know this fact well. They will give their eyes several hours to adapt instead of a few minutes in order to maximize their vision of the dim stars. In summary, upon exposure to darkness, our pupils dilate in a matter of seconds, our cones adapt in 10 minutes, and our rods adapt completely after several hours.";dropped,driven,of,tight,liquid

";Camels do not store water in their humps. Instead, camels use the humps to store energy-rich fat deposits. Many animals, including humans, use body fat as an energy storage. Unique to a camel, however, is the fact that it stores the fat in a hump up on top instead of around the belly or limbs. It does this to stay cool. ;Fat has a natural tendency to insulate heat, acting like a blanket to bodies that are covered in fat. Being a hot-climate animal, a camel would waste energy trying to cool down if its fat were wrapped around its body. Instead, by placing the fat in a hump that is out of the way, the camel can stay as cool as possible while still having an energy reserve. Think of it like a tourist from northern Siberia with a coat stuffed full of snacks just stepping off the plane in the Sahara Desert. What does he immediately do? He takes off his coat and slings it over his shoulder. He still wants to lug around his coat full of snacks, he just does not want it wrapped around him making him hot.;To handle hot and arid conditions, camels have many interesting adaptations. Among them is the ability to go a long time without drinking water and the ability to drink large quantities of water very quickly. A typical camel can drink 200 liters (53 gallons) of water in three minutes. Perhaps this is where the misunderstanding arises that camels store water in their humps. After all, the water has to go somewhere. In reality, the water goes into the animal's digestion and circulatory system.;chance,human,kept,though,directly
Edexcel;O;2281 - Economics,;2004;Jan Feb;How strong does a non-toxic odor have to be before it damages your sense of smell?;The sense of smell does not really work that way. If an odor, such as the smell of a strawberry, is not chemically reactive enough to do damage, your sense of smell will remain unharmed no matter how strong the smell becomes. In this way, the sense of smell is very different from the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.;"The brightness of a light is a measure of its energy content. A brighter beam of light carries more energy. Therefore, light can be bright enough that it dumps enough energy into your eyes to damage them. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is a measure of its energy content. A louder sound carries more energy. In this way, sound can be loud enough to dump enough energy into your ears to cause damage. In contrast, the strength of a particular odor is not a measure of its energy content, but is a measure of the number of odor molecules in a given volume. A stronger concentration of a particular order that reaches your nose is not dumping more energy in your nose. It is dumping more odor molecules in your nose. Your nose contains an array of smell receptors (olfactory nerves). When the odor molecules bind to these smell receptors, they trigger a signal to the brain telling it that something was smelled. The more odor molecules there are present, the more binding there is to the smell receptors, and the stronger the smell signal that reaches your brain.

If a particular non-toxic odor is too strong, this just means that it carries too many odor molecules for your sense receptors to bind to, and not that it is dumping too much energy into your nose. Therefore, if a particular odor is not toxic, it will do no damage no matter how strong the smell becomes. If the smell of bacon gets too strong, you simply stop noticing that the smell is getting stronger because your sense receptors are saturated, but no damage is done and no pain is felt.

Odors that are chemically reactive enough will affect your sense receptors at any concentration. At low concentrations, the effect is minimal. At higher concentrations, the inhaled toxic chemical can lead to nasal irritation, long-term damage, and even cancer. For example, hydogen sulfide gives a recognizable rotten-egg smell at a concentration of about 5 parts per billion, becomes annoying at about 100 parts per billion, causes irritation at about 10,000 parts per billion, and causes lasting damage and even death at higher concentrations.";"In the textbook Taste and Smell Disorders edited by Allen M. Seiden, the authors Lloyd Hastings and Marian L. Miller write, ""Among the many causes leading to decrements in olfactory function, exposure to toxic compounds, especially those airborne, represents a small but important percentage of the cases presenting for evaluation...Exposure to levels of irritants sufficient to alter olfactory function usually occurs only after accidental exposure.""";teach,pay,height,feel,roll
Edexcel;O;2281 - Economics,;2011;May Jun;"Is human blood ever any color other than red?
";"Yes, human blood is green in the deep ocean. We have to be careful about what we mean by color. Objects don't really have an intrinsic color. Rather, the color of an object is determined by three factors: 1) the color content of the incident light that is illuminating the object; 2) the way the object reflects, absorbs, and transmits the incident colors of light; and 3) the way in which the detector such as your eye or a camera detects and interprets the colors of light coming from the object. In everyday life, the incident light (such as from the sun or from a light bulb) typically contains all colors of visible light in nearly equal proportions. Furthermore, the healthy human eye can detect all colors of visible light. For these two reasons, in typical circumstances, we can treat the color of an object as only depending on the properties of the object itself. However, once we move away from typical circumstances, we have to use the more complete description of color, which involves the light source, the object, and the detector. With this in mind, let's turn to the color of blood.";"As reported in the journal Applied Spectroscopy, Martina Meinke and her collaborators measured the diffuse reflectance of human blood and found the spectrum which is shown below. This particular spectrum is for blood with a hematocrit (the percent of the blood's volume taken up by red blood cells) of 33% and oxygen saturation of 100%. These researchers also measured the reflectance spectrum of blood for other hematocrit values and oxygen saturation values. They found that although the spectrum slightly changes for different hematrocrit and oxygen saturation values, the overall trend shown below remains the same. Therefore, in terms of the overall trend, the image below is a good representation of the reflectance of any human's blood. (Note that even deoxygenated blood follows these trends and is dominantly red, not blue.)

blood spectrum

As we see in the image above, blood mostly reflects red light. Interestingly, though, blood also reflects a little bit of green light. If we shine white light (which contains all colors) onto the blood, blood looks red since it reflects so much more red light than green light. However, if we use a light source that contains all of the visible colors except red and shine it onto the blood, the blood will be green. With no red light present in the first place, the blood can't reflect any red light. The only thing left that it can reflect is the green light. The blood is therefore green. Note that this is not a trick of the eyes. The blood is literally green. In fact, human blood is always a little bit green. We usally don't notice the green color of blood because there is typically so much more red light being reflected by the blood. But if you shine a light on the blood that contains green light but no red light, the green color of blood becomes obvious.";This is exactly what happens deep in the ocean. Water is naturally very slightly blue colored because it absorbs some of the red light passing through. The deeper you go in the ocean, the less red light there is in the sunlight that reaches you. Without red color in the sunlight, only green light reflects from the blood. This fact can be startling to divers who get a cut while diving. Again, the blood does not change when in the deep ocean. Rather, the green color of blood that is always there becomes obvious once the brighter red color is no longer present. Since the green reflectance peak of blood is always there, blood can be obviously green anytime you have a light source with no red color, and not just in the deep ocean.;planning,height,room,planning,gently
Edexcel;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2019;Jan Feb;"Is ionizing radiation always harmful?
";No, ionizing radiation is only harmful to an organism as a whole when its amount gets too high. We are constantly bombarded with very small amounts of ionizing radiation that occur naturally, and we get along just fine with our lives without being seriously harmed by this radiation. There are trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive atoms in the air, in the rocks, in our food, and inside our bodies. When these atoms radioactively decay, they emit ionizing radiation.;"By its nature of being ionizing, such radiation can damage individual molecules, even at low intensity. But if the amount of ionizing radiation exposure is very low, our bodies can handle a few damaged molecules without any problem, so that there is no net harm done to our bodies.

Ionizing radiation is radiation that has enough energy per particle to rip electrons off of atoms and therefore break chemical bonds. In contrast, radiation types such as microwaves, radio waves, and visible light are non-ionizing, meaning that they do not have enough energy to permanently damage molecules beyond simple heating effects. Ionizing radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays, neutron radiation, proton radiation, and high-speed electrons. Natural sources of ionizing radiation include the radioactive decay of unstable atoms that exist everywhere and cosmic rays from space. Man-made sources include medical scans such as X-ray images as well as nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons testing, and any industrial or scientific process that involves nuclear reactions or high energies. Advocating that humans cease all nuclear activity in order that our exposure to ionizing radiation will be reduced to zero makes no sense since we will always be exposed to some amount of ionizing radiation from natural sources. The more logical approach is to allow nuclear research and technology to proceed, but put strong regulations and safety procedures in place so that humans are never exposed to ionizing radiation amounts that are above the safety threshold.

The amount of total harm that ionizing radiation can cause a human depends on the total amount of radiation received, which is a function of the intensity of the radiation and the length of time that the person is exposed to the radiation. The total amount of ionizing radiation received by a body is termed the ""dose"". Since different tissues react differently to ionizing radiation, of more importance is the ""effective dose"", which is the total amount of ionizing radiation received that is able to do biological damage. A person that is exposed to higher-than-normal levels of radiation, but only for limited amounts of time, will not receive a significantly higher effective dose and thus may still be in the safe zone. For instance, employees can safely work in nuclear reactor facilities as long as they monitor their radiation exposure and limit their time in the facilities so that their dose does not exceed safe levels.

It is hard to set one standard threshold above which radiation exposure becomes seriously harmful since the definition of ""seriously harmful"" is subjective. Medium-low doses of ionizing radiation can still cause nausea and may still cause a miniscule increase in the chance of getting cancer, although this increase may be too small to be considered significant. Despite the complexity of this field, general safety thresholds can still be set. Experimentally, cancer risk has only been found to increase for doses above 100 mSv per year according to the World Nuclear Association. A good safety threshold should therefore be set at a value that is well below 100 mSv per year. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission sets the occupational safety limit for ionizing radiation exposure to be 50 mSv per year. For comparison, natural background radiation provides a dose of 3 mSv per year, a single typical banana provides 0.0001 mSv, a single set of dental X-rays provides about 0.005 mSv, a single set of barium X-rays provides about 5 mSv, and a single full-body CT scan provides about 20 mSv. As you can see, a single medical scan is too weak to cause harm even though it may involve ionizing radiation. On the other hand, undergoing several full-body CT scans in a short period of time can make the radiation add up to a total dose that is at a harmful level. For this reason, medical doctors are trained to avoid ordering too many radiation-intensive scans for a single patient in a short amount of time (unless the benefits outweigh the risks, e.g. if the scan helps save a patient from imminent death, it is worth the increased cancer risk).";When the dose is high enough, ionizing radiation causes two types of harm to humans: direct tissue damage and cancer. Direct tissue damage happens when enough molecules are broken apart that the cells simply can no longer function. This can lead to radiation burns, radiation sickness, organ failure, and even death. In contrast, cancer results when the cells receive a small enough amount of damage that they can still live and function, but damage to the genes causes the cells to pursue aggressive and uncontrolled growth.;whistle,basis,fell,frequently,laid
Cambridge;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2016;Jan Feb;"Is it completely random whether a baby is a boy or a girl?
";Although the evidence is not yet extensive enough to be conclusive, analysis of genetic mechanisms seems to suggest that whether a certain couple will give birth to a boy versus a girl may not be completely random (i.e. a 50%-50% chance). Certain instances of conception and child-bearing may be slightly more likely to lead to the birth of a particular sex. There are several possible mechanisms that could cause this to happen.;"First let's review some basics. Biological sex in healthy humans is determined by the presence of the sex chromosomes in the genetic code: two X chromosomes (XX) makes a girl, whereas an X and a Y chromosome (XY) makes a boy. In this way, it is the presence or absence of the Y chromosome in a healthy human that differentiates boy from girl. When a healthy human is conceived, it receives one sex chromosome from the mother and one sex chromosome from the father. Since the mother only has X chromosomes to give, it should be obvious that it is the father's cells that determine whether the baby will genetically be a boy or a girl. The father's genetic code is delivered to the newly conceived individual by sperm cells which are generated in the father's gonads by the process of meiosis. In the normal father, half of the sperm cells each carry one X chromosome and will ultimately lead to a girl upon conception, while the other half of the sperm cells each carry a Y chromosome and will ultimately lead to a boy. In the meiosis process in the father's testes, a primary spermatocyte cell with a full set of chromosomes undergoes duplication and two steps of divisions so that it ends up as four sperm cells, each with only a half-set of chromosomes. In normal meiosis, one primary spermatocyte ultimately becomes four sperm cells: X, X, Y, and Y. Therefore, if meiosis is normal and no other factors are involved, there should be a 50% chance of conceiving a boy or girl. But sometimes meiosis can malfunction and the sperm cells don't end up normal.

One possible end result of a meiosis error is the spermatocyte becoming the four sperm cells: X, 0, XY, and Y. In this case, the Y chromosome that was supposed to end up in its own sperm failed to separate from its X chromosome partner. As a result, one sperm abnormally contains both an X and a Y chromosome while another sperm contains no sex chromosomes. Keeping in mind that the mother always provides an X chromosome (or multiple X chromosomes in abnormal situations), the four possible babies from these four sperm cells are: XX, X, XXY, and XY. The XX possibility is a normal girl, the X possibility is a girl with Turner syndrome, XXY is a boy with Klinefelter syndrome, and XY is a normal boy. Even though this meiosis error leads to chromosomal abnormalities and health problems, it still maintains a 50% chance of boy and a 50% chance of girl, at least in terms of sperm availability. However, embryos with abnormal chromosomes have a much harder time surviving until birth. Only about 1% of Turner syndrome girls survive until birth, whereas about 20% of Klinefelter syndrome boys survive until birth. Therefore, when we take into account prenatal survival rates, we see that this meiosis error leads to a greater probability of giving birth to a boy. (Note that the situation is somewhat more complicated than this simple picture suggests because meiosis errors in the mother can also lead to Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome. However, the general point still stands that this is a plausible mechanism for sex ratio discrepancies.)

Another possible end result of a meiosis error is the spermatocyte becoming the four sperm cells: X, X, YY, and 0. This would lead to the four possible babies: XX, XX, XYY, and X. Both XX possibilities are normal girls, the XYY possibility is a boy with XYY syndrome, and the X possibility is again a girl with Turner syndrome. Thus, looking at just sperm availability, this error leads to a three-in-four chance of conceiving a girl and a one-in-four chance of conceiving a boy. If we take into account the fact that only 1% of Turner syndrome girls survive until birth, whereas most XYY boys function normally and survive to birth, the probabilities are closer to a two-in-three chance of girl and a one-in-three chance of boy.

The last major possibility for a meiosis error is for the spermatocyte to produce the four sperm cells: 0, XX, Y, and Y. This would lead to the four possible babies: X, XXX, XY, and XY. In other words, this error leads to the possible outcomes of a Turner syndrome girl, a girl with XXX syndrome, and two normal boys. In this case, there is again a 50% chance of a girl and a 50% change of a boy in terms of sperm availability. Again, most Turner syndrome girls do not survive until birth. In contrast, XXX syndrome girls function mostly normally and survive to birth. Therefore, the probabilities are closer to one-in-three for girl and two-in-three for boy.

The possibility of a diminished prenatal viability skewing the girl-boy probabilities extends even to girls and boys with the normal number of sex chromosomes. For instance, if a father is a carrier for an X-linked disease, then his daughters could inherit the disease whereas his sons cannot (since they only receive a Y chromosome from their father). If the disease is serious enough to cause most of the girls with the disease to not survive to birth, then this father is genetically biased to have more boys than girl. Similarly, if a father is a carrier for a serious Y-linked disease, then he may be more disposed to have girls.

Another mechanism that could possibly affect girl-boy probabilities is androgen insensitivity. Androgen insensitivity is a genetic disorder where an individual is not able to produce the receptor that responds to androgen hormones. Androgen hormones are the ones that signal to a fetus to develop into a boy. As a result, individuals with complete androgen insensitivity will develop into girls, regardless of whether they have XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes. Therefore, a mother that is a carrier for androgen insensitivity has a higher probability of giving birth to girls.

Beyond abnormalities, there is the possibility that some men may actually have a gene that code for the biased production of X sperm (or Y sperm). In a paper published in Evolutionary Biology, Corry Gellatly presents simulation results that demonstrate the plausibility of this mechanism. However, there is little biochemical evidence at this point of such a gene.";"In addition to genetic mechanisms, environmental factors may have an influence on the probability of bearing a boy versus a girl. Many studies have been performed on various specific environmental factors and their role in influencing the sex ratio. However, the results of these studies are mostly limited and inconsistent.

The bottom line is that there is not yet enough consistent evidence to allow us to make conclusive statements about exactly what factors alter the sex ratio, but there certainly are many plausible mechanisms that could lead the sex of a new baby to not be completely random.";parallel,parallel,pleasant,them,official
Cambridge;AS;7707 - Accounting;2013;Oct Nov;"What are the five senses of the human body?
";There are not just five senses in a human body. A healthy human can sense its environment and its internal state through dozens of channels. Eyesight provides the most information to the brain per second and is the most important sense. The second most information-rich sense is hearing. Next up comes the sense of touch. But what is commonly called the sense of touch is actually a group of many independent senses including: hot, cold, pressure, pain, itching, and tingling.;"Each of these senses has its own receptor and therefore its own unique path to the brain, as explained in the textbook ""Psychology: Concepts and Applications"" by Jeffrey S. Nevid. Furthermore, there are actually three different types of pain senses: skin pain, joint pain, and organ pain. The sense of smell and taste are the other two common senses most people think of. The senses perhaps most valued by athletes are the senses of linear and angular accelerations, which are carried out by the inner ear. These senses are commonly known as ""balance"". The kinesthetic sense is the body's ability to sense where its limbs are even with the lights off. Other senses with unique nerve pathways include stretching, suffocation, nausea, hunger, thirst, blushing, choking, and the need to urinate and defecate. Each of these dozens of senses plays a role in keeping us alive, well maintained, and interacting with our environment.";;friendly,glass,acres,blue,fell
Edexcel;O;2281 - Economics,;2016;May Jun;"What chemicals can make human tissue regenerate in seconds?
";No chemicals can make human tissue regenerate in seconds. Biological tissue is composed mainly of a large collection of cells sitting in a scaffolding of proteins and sugar chains (the extracellular matrix) and bathed in fluids that carry various chemicals between the cells. The regeneration of tissue mainly involves the fabrication of the extracellular matrix, which is secreted by cells, and the creation of new cells by way of cell division.x;"Therefore, the rate at which tissue regenerates is mainly limited by how fast one cell can divide into two new, fully-functional cells that then become mature enough to divide again. This cell reproduction time depends on the type of cell, but for humans the shortest duration of a single cell cycle is about one day. In order to generate a decent amount of tissue, several cell cycles will be needed, so the total time to regenerate tissue is at the very best a few days. This number is an absolute minimum. In most cases, it will take far longer for a human to regenerate a significant amount of tissue; from weeks to months. Furthermore, if the need to regenerate is caused by acute damage to the tissue, the body may respond by forming a scar rather than regenerating the tissue. Certain types of human tissue simply can't regenerate on their own in response to significant injury. Even if we could apply chemicals that force the tissue to regenerate as fast as possible (but still remain as somewhat normal human cells), the best we can do is to have tissue regenerate in few day, not in a few seconds.";A few exotic non-human embryo cells can reproduce as fast as every 8 minutes. However, such reproduction is so fast this it does not allow enough time for the cells to grow in size. They only divide into smaller cells while the overall volume of the tissue remains the same. So this would not really count as tissue regeneration in 8 minutes. Assuming it did count, this would mean that with extensive genetic engineering to make human cells act like these exotic non-human embryo cells, the best we could ever do is to get tissue regeneration in 8 minutes, not in a matter of seconds. This is simply a plausibility limit. It is doubtful that this regeneration time could ever be achieved, even with the best genetic engineering. Again, the fastest human cell cycle duration is a day.;means,plural,parallel,double,product
Edexcel;AS;4024 - Mathematics D;2010;Aug Sep;What is it about a full moon that makes people do crazy things and commit crimes?;There are no statistically significant records indicating any connection between crime waves or full hospitals and the full moon, according to the National Geographic News. This misunderstanding perhaps has its source in a long line of mythology. Werewolves were said to be humans that turned into wolves during the full moon.;"The sophisticated culture of today perhaps modernized this myth to say that people only act like wolves during full moons, but don't actually turn into wolves. The werewolf myth has its roots in another myth; the belief that real wolves howl at the full moon but not at any other kind of moon. This particular belief, which is scientifically false, traces all the way back to the mythology of the Greek and Roman gods.

The moon's gravity is strong enough to help cause the ocean tides, but too weak to do much else. Weak forces only produce significant effects when there is a lot of material to act on. In the case of the moon, the immense size of the oceans and their fluid nature makes the weak gravity of the moon add up to significant effects in the form of tides. In contrast, humans are so small compared to the oceans, that the effect of the moon's gravity on humans is negligible. Even if the moon's gravity was strong enough to affect humans, it would do nothing more than make us slightly heavier or lighter. Gravity is just a force that pulls on mass. Gravity does nothing mystical or psychological to the objects it acts on.";;energy,regular,limited,pound,tight
Cambridge;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2004;May Jun;"What is it about red that makes bulls so angry?
";"The color red does not make bulls angry. In fact, bulls are partially color blind compared to healthy humans, so that they cannot see red. According to the book ""Improving Animal Welfare"" by Temple Grandin, cattle lack the red retina receptor and can only see yellow, green, blue, and violet colors.";Color vision in mammals is accomplished by a collection of cone cells on the back of the eye (the retina). There are three kinds of cone cells: one kind that detects predominantly red colors, another kind that detects mainly green, and the last kind that detects mainly blue. Although cone cells respond most strongly to their main color, they can still respond to other close colors. This color overlap of the cones' sensitivity is what allows us to see so many colors. For instance, a pure yellow color stimulates both the red cone and the green cone, and we experience the combination as yellow. If instead of looking at a pure yellow dot of light, you looked instead at a red dot very close to a green dot with the right balance, you would still experience yellow because the red cones and green cones are being stimulated in the same way. This fact makes the manufacture of computer screens very practical. Instead of implanting a million pixels into a computer screen at every point, each with a different color, the manufacturer only has to construct a grid of red, green, and blue pixels. Humans are actually looking at an array of red, green, and blue dots on a screen but perceive millions of colors. Most mammals, including bulls, are dichromats. This means that they only have two different kinds of cones, as opposed to the three in humans. Bulls lack the red cones, but still have the green and blue cones. A bull's vision is very similar to the vision of a human with red-cone color blindness, known as protanopia. To them, a red cape looks yellowish-gray. It is perhaps the threatening, waving motion of the matador's red cape that enrages a bull, and not the color.;;especially,planning,operation,adventure,golden
Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2006;Oct Nov;"When did humans stop evolving?
";Humans have never stopped evolving and continue to do so today. Evolution is a slow process that takes many generations of reproduction to become evident. Because humans take so long to reproduce, it takes hundreds to thousands of years for changes in humans to become evident. We simply don't notice the evolution of humans from day to day because it is happening so slowly. But creatures that reproduce more quickly also evolve more quickly. For instance, bacteria can reproduce within 20 minutes, so their evolution can be watched by scientists over the course of a few days. All creatures are always evolving. There is no way to stop evolution.;"Some people think that humans' development of technology has enabled us to short-circuit evolution, or step outside of evolution. But evolution is not some magical transformation that happens in the wild to dim-witted creatures, propelling them ever towards greater complexity. Evolution is just the observation that creatures change over time because varieties that do best at surviving and reproducing in a given environment are more able to pass their genetic traits on to the next generation. Technology is part of evolution, as is poetry and economics, in so far as they affect survival and reproduction, and can be passed on genetically. Those races that use technology in order to better survive and reproduce are able to pass along their technology-minded genes to the next generation. Technology is not evidence that the evolutionary process has been destroyed or side-stepped. Rather, technology is direct evidence that evolution is still at work. Technology is so effective at helping the human species to survive and reproduce that humans have come to dominate the globe in the process, and technology has proliferated.

You many counter, ""But modern medicine has kept alive people with disease-causing genes who should have been weeded out by evolution. Humans should be getting stronger as the weaker people die and fail to reproduce, but modern medicine is keeping the weaker people alive and has therefore bypassed evolution."" My response to this is: there is no ""should"" in evolution. Evolution is not goal-oriented; it has no end purpose. Confusing improvement with evolution leads to misguided practices such as eugenics. Medicine does not bypass evolution; it is just evolution in a different form. Groups of people who have brains that are adept at developing and applying modern medicine survive more and pass along their brains to their children.

We have to be very careful here in the words we use. Evolution in the strict scientific sense is the passing on of advantageous traits from one generation to the next through the genes, and not through education or reform. Giving my son a good education will help him personally, but it does not really change his genetic code and therefore is not part of evolution. On the other hand, having a genetic mutation that gives me a more powerful brain, which I then use to create technology that aids in my survival and reproduction, is evolution. I am able to pass on to my son the gene so that he has a more powerful brain as well.

So what will humans look like in 500 years if they are still evolving? This is a hard thing to predict. Humans and human society are so complex at this point that you can't really pinpoint one isolated trait besides their big brains that makes them survive and reproduce better. Accurate scientific predictions about the evolution of humans are nearly impossible. Weather forecasters can't predict what a handful of elements in the sky will do a week from now, so predicting what the complex web of humanity will become in hundreds of years is out of the question. But, for the sake of illustrating how evolution works, we can engage in some unfounded speculation. The leading causes of death may give us some hints about future human evolution. We have to be careful and only consider the leading causes of death among people who are young enough to reproduce, say, before the age of 35. Those that have a genetic makeup that predisposes them to better survive the leading causes of death among those younger than 35 years will be able to pass their genes on to the next generation and therefore influence the course of human evolution. According to the CDC, the leading causes of death in the US for people younger than 35 are unintentional injuries (such as car accidents), suicide, homicide, and cancer. Whatever biological traits enable a person in the US to avoid fatal injuries, suicide, homicide, and cancer will become the traits more pronounced in humans in the US as they evolve. For example, humans could evolve to become less risky (thus avoiding accidents), more religious (thus avoiding suicides and homicides), and more disgusted by smoking and alcohol (thus avoiding lung and liver cancer). Note that heart disease is one of the top killers overall in the US. You may be tempted to conclude that humans will evolve to be more resistant to heart disease, or will evolve to crave heart-healthy foods more. But if you look at the CDC data of mortality by age, you find that heart disease is only a top killer for people over 45 years old, which is passed the main child-bearing years. Heart disease therefore has little influence on reproduction, and, by extension, little influence on evolution.

Another way to get some hints into future human evolution is to look at births instead of deaths. The countries with the highest birth rates are in Africa. Even though such countries have high death rates, the birth rate is high enough to compensate for this. This fact is a hint that humans may evolve to look more like native Africans. If we instead look at behavior instead of nationality, a consistent factor linked to high birth rate across all cultures is religiosity. People with strong religious sentiments tend to have more children. Furthermore, the degree of religiosity is directly proportional to the amount of children a person has. This fact hints that humans are destined to evolve to become more religious. In summary, if these hints are any guide, we can expect humans to evolve in the next few hundred years to be more religious, less risky, less drawn to drugs, and more African in appearance. Again, these ideas are pure speculation and are meant only to illustrate how evolution works through survival and reproduction, and not to make actual scientific predictions about the future of human evolution (which is nearly impossible).";Note that it is very unlikely at this point in human evolution that we will sprout wings, a third arm, or purple skin. The survival advantages of such major morphological changes have long been surpassed by applications of human intelligence. Humans can already use their brains to build airplanes. There is therefore no survival advantage we would gain from growing wings. Any disadvantage that humans have because of basic structure has been compensated for by human-made machines. The future of human evolution will therefore most likely involve the brain and the chemical/hormonal systems that support the brain.;season,touch,directly,of,riding
Cambridge;A;2210 - Computer Science;2021;Aug Sep;"When do birds use their teeth?
";Birds do not have teeth. Without teeth, a bird cannot chew its food down to bits in its mouth like humans do. As detailed in the textbook Ornithology by Frank B. Gill, birds must instead rely on the muscular stomach-like pouch called the gizzard to crush down their food. Many species swallow stones and grit to aid in digestion. These stones remain in the gizzard and crush the food as the gizzard contracts. From a functional perspective, gizzard stones in birds are the equivalent of teeth in humans. ;When a gizzard stone becomes too smooth to do its job, the bird regurgitates the stone or passes the stone down and out through its digestive tract. Species that do not swallow stones are able to use the sheer muscle power of their gizzards to grind down their food. Birds do not have teeth because the teeth and the jaw bone to support them are too heavy for efficient flight. Many birds have a series of notches in their beak or spikes on the inside of their beak or tongue. These notches and spikes are not true teeth as they are not used to crush down their food. Instead, these features are used to get a good grip on the prey so that it does not escape. In ancient evolutionary history, there were birds with true teeth. Known as odontornithes, these animals are no longer alive today.;;driven,though,composition,using,clean
Cambridge;A;2210 - Computer Science;2018;May Jun;"Where in my body is the original cell from which I was formed?
";From one point of view, the original cell you came from (the fertilized egg cell) was destroyed long before your body was formed. From another point of view, every cell in your body is the original. In either case, there is not just one original cell sitting in your elbow or toe that can be identified as the ancestor of all your other cells. Let us look at the mechanics of cell reproduction to make sense of this.;"Two cells are formed from one cell through the process of cell division. In cell division, the DNA within a cell is replicated. The two copies of the DNA are then separated into two different cell nuclei. The cell then splits into two pieces, each piece containing its own set of DNA. In this way, two identical cells are now sitting where one used to be. You can't really identify one of the new cells as the ""original cell"" and the other cell as a mere copy, because the process is symmetric. Don't think of cell division as a builder constructing a new house patterned after his old house. Cell division is more like a builder cutting his old house in half and turning each half into a self-contained house. You can't really identity one of the new houses as the original house. They are both part of the original house. At the same time, they both aren't, because the original house was destroyed when you cut it in half. The case is similar with cell division.

You began life as a single cell. You became a fully-functioning, independent human after many cell divisions turned that first cell into the trillions of cells that make up your body. In a strict sense, that first cell was destroyed when it underwent the very first cell division. But the essence of the first cell, your DNA, was given to both daughter cells in the process of cell division. The essence of who you are continued to be passed along with each cell division, until all the trillions of your cells had been completed. From a philosophical perspective, the original cell lives on in all of your cells.";Note that even if the first cell had not been destroyed during cell division, it would have still been destroyed eventually through the normal wear and tear of life. Almost all of your cells die within a few days to a few years, depending on where they are in the body. Your cells are in a constant state of dieing and being replaced by new cells. As a result, very few of the cells in your body now are the exact same cells that you had 20 years ago. According to a study done by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, outer gut cells die after a few days, outer skin cells die after two weeks, red blood cells last four months, liver cells last a year, and bone cells last about a decade.;applied,brick,ice,before,giving
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2009;Oct Nov;"Why are bats blind?
";Bats are not blind and can in fact see quite well using their eyes. While most bats do have advanced ears that give them a form of vision in the dark known as echolocation, these good ears does not require them to have bad eyes. Bats use their good hearing to find food in the dark of night, and their good eyes to find food during the light of day. The vision of bats is tuned to low-light conditions such as is present during dawn and dusk. While some bats may not have as good color vision as humans, their overall vision may be better than humans during dawn and dusk.;"In their book on bats, authors Barbara Schmidt-French and Carol Butler state, ""Someone with poor vision is commonly called â€˜blind as a bat,' but the expression is inappropriate since bats can actually see quite well, with visual acuity varying from one species to another. Both megabat and microbats rely on vision during social interactions with one another, to watch for predators, and for navigating across landscapes. Megabats have large eyes and depend on vision to orient themselves during flight and to find food. Most microbats use echolocation to navigate and find food, and they tend to have smaller eyes, although they, too, use vision during their daily activities and to detect objects outside the effective range of echolocation, which is about thirty-three to sixty-six feet (ten to twenty meters). Some bats are also capable of visual pattern discrimination, which may assist fruit or nectar bats in finding food."" Taken literally, the comment, ""you are as blind as a bat,"" should mean that you have excellent vision in low light conditions, although it is usually meant to imply you have bad vision overall. This phrase perhaps originated from the fact that bats have rapid, erratic flight patterns that look like a blind person bumbling about.";;moving,syllable,danger,them,found
Cambridge;O;2281 - Economics,;2004;May Jun;"Why are human brains the biggest?
";The brains of humans are not the biggest compared to all other animals. The average human brain has a mass of about 1 kg. In contrast, the brain of a sperm whale has a mass of 8 kg and that of an elephant has a mass of 5 kg. You may be tempted to think that bigger brains means smarter and that because humans are the smartest animals, we must have the biggest brains.;"But biology does not work that way. When an animal has a larger overall size, all of its organs must be generally bigger just to keep it alive. A sperm whale weighs 35 to 45 metric tons and stretches about 15 meters long. With so much biological tissue to take care of, the sperm whale needs a giant heart to keep blood pumping to all this tissue, giant lungs to provide oxygen to all this tissue, and a giant brain to coordinate it all. The sperm whale needs a giant brain not because it is intelligent, but because it has so much low-level functions to carry out with such a huge body.

Intelligence is instead more strongly linked to the brain size relative to the body size. If a large brain is housed in a small body, there is less low-level signal processing and control that the brain has to carry out. As a result, the brain can be freed up for more higher-order thinking. But even this picture is over-simplified. Intelligence seems to depend on many things: absolute brain size, relative brain size, connectivity, energy expenditure, etc. But as a rough model, relative brain size is indeed correlated to intelligence within main groups of organisms. While humans do not have the biggest brains overall, we do have the biggest brains relative to our body size among the mammals.";;its,service,plural,properly,sick
Cambridge;AS;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2016;Aug Sep;Why are red, yellow, and blue the primary colors in painting but computer screens use red, green, and blue?;"Red, yellow, and blue are not the main primary colors of painting, and in fact are not very good primary colors for any application.

First of all, you can define any colors you want to be the ""primary colors"" of your color system, so that other colors are obtained by mixing the primary colors. Although there may be an infinite number of color systems, they are not all equally useful, practical, or effective. For instance, I am free to create a color system where I define light blue, medium blue, and violet as my primary colors. Even though I am free to define my primary colors as such, this color system is not very useful in general because no amount of mixing of these primary colors will produce red, orange, yellow, etc.";"Therefore, we should make a distinction between a color system and an effective color system. The effectiveness of a color system is best measured as the number of different colors that can be created by mixing the primary colors of the system. This set of colors is called the ""color gamut"" of the system. A color system with a large gamut is more able to effectively represent a wide variety of images containing different colors.

The most effective color systems are those that closely match the physical workings of the human eye, since it is ultimately the human eye which experiences the color. The human eye contains a curved array of light-sensing cells shaped like little cones and rods. Colored light is detected by the cone cells. The cone cells come in three varieties: red-detecting, green-detecting, and blue-detecting. They are so named because the red cone cells mostly detect red light, the green cone cells mostly detect green light, and the blue cone cells mostly detect blue light. Note that even though a red cone cell predominantly detects the color red, it can also detect a little bit of some other colors. Therefore, even though humans do not have yellow cone cells, we can still see yellow light when it triggers a red cone cell and a green cone cell. In this way, humans have a built-in color decoding mechanism which enables us to experience millions of colors, although we only have vision cells that predominantly see red, green, and blue. It should be obvious at this point that the most effective color systems are ones that closely match the human eye, i.e. color systems that mix red, green, and blue light.

There is a slight complication because there are really two main ways to create a light beam. We can either create the light directly using light sources or we can reflect white light off of a material that absorbs certain colors. A system that creates light directly is called an ""additive"" color system since the colors from the different light sources add together to give the final beam of light. Examples of additive color systems are computer screens. Each image pixel of a computer screen is just a small collection of light sources emitting different colors. If you display an image of a pumpkin on your computer screen, you have not really turned on any orange-emitting light sources in the screen. Rather, you have turned on tiny red-emitting light sources as well as tiny green-emitting light sources in the screen, and the red and green light add together to make orange.

additive and subtractive color mixing
The top image shows how red, green, and blue add to make other colors, such as in computer screens. The bottom image shows how cyan, magenta, and yellow subtract to make other colors, such as in inks. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
In contrast to an additive system, color systems that remove colors through absorption are called ""subtractive"" color systems. They are called this because the final color is achieved by starting with white light (which contains all colors) and then subtracting away certain colors, leaving other colors. Examples of subtractive color systems are paints, pigments, and inks. An orange pumpkin that you see printed in a newspaper is not necessarily created by spraying orange ink on the paper. Rather, yellow ink and magenta ink are sprayed onto the paper. The yellow ink absorbs blue light and a little green and red from the white light beam, while the magenta ink absorbs green light and a little blue and red, leaving only orange to be reflected back.

There are therefore two equally-valid methods for creating color: additive systems and subtractive systems. With this in mind, there are thus two color systems that are most effective (i.e. most able to match the human eye): (1) an additive system that creates red, green, and blue light and, (2) a subtractive system that creates red, green, and blue light.

For an additive system, light is created directly. This means that the primary colors of the most effective additive color system are simply red, green, and blue (RGB). This is why most computer screens, from iPods to televisions, contain a grid of little red-, green-, and blue-emitting light sources.

For a subtractive color system, a certain reflected color is obtained by absorbing the opposite color. Therefore, the primary colors of the most effective subtractive system are the opposites of red, green, and blue, which happen to be cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). This is why most printed images contain a grid of little cyan, magenta, and yellow dots of ink. Cyan is the opposite of red and is halfway between green and blue. Magenta is the opposite of green and is halfway between blue and red, and yellow is the opposite of blue and is halfway between red and green.";"In summary, the most effective color systems are red-green-blue for additive color systems and cyan-magenta-yellow for subtractive color systems.

So where did the red-yellow-blue color system come from that they teach in elementary school? Typically, students first encounter color concepts when painting in an art class in grade school. Paint is a subtractive color system, and therefore the most effective primary colors for painting are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Note that high-quality paintings typically do not use just three primary colors since more vivid scenes can be achieved using dozens of primary colors. But when teaching art, it's easier to start more simply; with just three primary colors. Now, to a little grade-schooler, the words ""cyan"" and ""magenta"" don't mean much. Furthermore, to an undiscerning youngster's eye, cyan looks awfully close to blue and magenta looks awfully close to red. Therefore, cyan-magneta-yellow becomes corrupted to blue-red-yellow. Elementary art teachers either ignorantly perpetuate this less effective color model (because that's how they were taught as children), or intentionally perpetuate it (because it's just too hard to teach six-year-old's the difference between cyan and blue). Historical tradition was also a prime driver of the red-yellow-blue color system since it was historically thought to be effective before the details of human vision were understood. Since the red-yellow-blue color system is less effective, it is not really used anywhere these days except in elementary school art.";pay,copper,shadow,shut,syllable
Edexcel;A;5014 - Environmental Management;2002;Aug Sep;"Why are veins blue?
";The veins themselves are not blue, but are mostly colorless. It is the blood in the veins that gives them color. Furthermore, the blood in human veins is also not blue. Blood is always red. Blood that has been oxygenated (mostly flowing through the arteries) is bright red and blood that has lost its oxygen (mostly flowing through the veins) is dark red. Anyone who has donated blood or had their blood drawn by a nurse can attest that deoxygenated blood is dark red and not blue.;"The blood in your veins appears blue because you are looking at your veins through layers of skin and fat according to Alwin Kienle in his paper ""Why do veins appear blue? A new look at an old question"" published in the Journal of Applied Optics. Skin scatters a lot of the red portion of white light before it can reflect off the blood, leaving the blue light to reflect off the blood and back to our eyes. It is a similar effect to how the white sun appears red at sunset due to the blue colors being scattered away by the atmosphere.";;personal,faster,clean,add,born
Edexcel;AS;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2010;Oct Nov;Why can only certain parts of the tongue taste sweet flavors? Is there an evolutionary benefit to this?;"All parts of the tongue can taste every flavor. The tongue, and indeed the sides of the mouth, the epiglottis and other tissues are all covered with taste buds. Each taste bud contains many taste cells that can taste different flavors. According to the textbook ""Neuroscience"" edited by Dale Purves, this misconception dates back to the research of German scientist D. P. Hanig, published in 1901.";Hanig simply noted down the subjective remarks of volunteers describing where they tasted a flavor. Unable to find a clear delineation of regions, Hanig recorded that certain areas of the tongue were slightly more sensitive to flavors than others based on statistically incomplete data. Other researchers interpreted his publication to mean that only certain parts of the tongue can taste certain flavors. Despite the ease of anybody disproving this theory by simply placing a pinch of salt at the tip of their tongue (which supposedly can only taste sweet), this misconception has lingered for a century. Perhaps the reason for the inability of this myth to die is the fact that a picture of a tongue with different parts colored and labeled makes for such an eye-catching image in science books. In 1905, Einstein published his landmark paper on special relativity. It is amazing that around the same time mankind was unraveling the mysteries of time travel, we were misunderstanding science that was literally on the tip of our tongue. More amazing is that this misunderstanding has persisted for over a century.;;ought,nuts,plus,feel,further

According to the business magazine ""Fast Company"", which interviewed several scientists and did its own experiment, frogs leap out of pots of hot water no matter how slowly you raise the temperature.

Cambridge;O;7707 - Accounting;2005;Aug Sep;"Why can't color blind people see any colors?
";Most people with color blindness can see almost all colors. They are typically only blind to a few colors. Furthermore, they are not completely blind to those colors, but are only partially blind. The human eye contains three types of color detecting cells: red-detecting cones, green-detecting cones, and blue-detecting cones. Each cone cell can detect many colors in addition to its main color. For instance, the cone cells in the eye that can see red light can also see orange and yellow. The red cone cells just see red the best, and that is why they are called the red cones. Similarly, the green cones can also see orange, yellow and blue. This overlap is what allows humans to see so many different colors. Humans can see the color yellow, for instance, even though there are no yellow receptors, because of this overlap. When you look at a yellow flower, the yellow light stimulates the red and green cells in your eyes, and your brain interprets a little bit of red plus a little bit of green as yellow.;"Typically, a color blind person has only one type of light cell absent or non-functioning. The textbook Color Vision, edited by Werner Backhaus, Reinhold Kliegl, and John Simon Werner, states that about 1% of Caucasian males have partial color blindness with one of the three color receptor types absent or non-functioning. This book further states that people who are completely color blind; those with all three types of receptors absent or non-functioning; are ""extremely rare"". People with protanopia color blindness lack the red detecting cone cells or pigments. As a result, they do not see red or orange colors as well. But they see all the other colors just fine. People with deuteranopia color blindness lack the green detecting cones or pigments, but have their other cones working just fine. People with tritanopia color blindness lack the blue detecting cones. People with these three types of partial color blindness only have problems with a few colors and can see most colors just fine.

You should keep in mind that the response of the different color-detecting cells overlap. When a person with full vision looks at a pure blue wall, it is not just his blue cone cells that are stimulated. His blue cone cells are stimulated a lot and his green cone cells are stimulated a little. His brain therefore experiences pure blue as a large blue cell signal plus a small green cell signal because of the way their responses overlap. Now apply this concept to a color blind person. A person with tritanopia is missing the blue-detecting cells in his eyes. When he looks at a blue wall, his blue cells don't see anything because he is missing the blue cells. But the green-detecting cells are still there, and they see blue a little bit. In this way, a typical color blind person is not really completely blind to any color. But his brain experiences a small green signal as dark green. A person with blue color blindness therefore experiences pure blue as dark green. His color perception is not complete and not quite right, but he does experience color, even in the color range where he has greatest difficulty. Whereas a person with full vision sees the colors green, blue, and violet, a person with blue color blindness sees these colors as green, dark green, and darker green. He sees color. He just sees the colors slightly wrong and has a harder time telling certain colors apart.

Another point to keep in mind is that most colors that we see in everyday life are a mixture of fundamental colors. For instance, in terms of fundamental colors, pink is a mixture of a lot of red plus a little of orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. When a person with blue color blindness looks at pink, only the blue part of the color mixture is faulty, which is a small part of the color pink. As a result, pink looks nearly normal to a person with blue color blindness. The same goes for other colors that are a mixture of fundamental colors.

Also, there is more to an object than its color. An object also has brightness, shading, texture, and shape. If a chair that is painted pure red is placed in front of a person with red color blindness, she would have no problem seeing the chair. She would still see the shape, shading, texture, and brightness of the chair. She would still see some color in the chair too. The chair would just look dark yellow instead of red. In this way, people with color blindness are not really ""blind"". They can see all objects just fine. Better phrases would be ""incomplete color vision"" or ""less sensitive color vision"".

Finally, people with color blindness learn to use mental tricks to compensate for the deficiency. For instance, oranges are always orange and stop signs are always red. A person with red color blindness has a harder time telling apart red and orange, but he can sure tell the difference between an orange and a stop sign. Even though the color difference between these two objects is very subtle for him, he feels that the color is very different because he associates the object identity with its color, and stop signs are very different from oranges. If you place a pure red posterboard next to a pure orange posterboard, a person with red color blindness may have a hard time identifying the red object. But place a stop sign next to an orange and ask him to identify the red object, and he will have no problem pointing to the stop sign as red. He may even think he is actually seeing red in this case, when he is just mostly seeing an object he has associated with the word red. Similarly, a color blind person typically has no problem driving and obeying traffic lights. You may think that he can't tell red lights from green lights and won't know when to stop or go. In reality, he may not see these lights in their full color, but he can see enough color to tell them apart. Additionally, he comes to associate the top light with red and the bottom light with green without even realizing it. He may tell you he is ""remembering the color"", when in reality he is remembering the location of the traffic light that means ""go"" and ""stop"". In this way, color blind people sometimes think they are fully seeing colors even though they are not because they are unconsciously relying on mental tricks and associations to compensate.";This post is meant in no way to trivialize or underestimate the burden that color blind people suffer in having incomplete color vision. Rather, this post is meant to simply uncover the science behind color blindness. Because of their sensitivity to most colors, the overlap of their cone cell response, and the other visual cues connected to an object, most people with color blindness have a nearly complete color experience.

Edexcel;A;7707 - Accounting;2016;Jan Feb;Why did evolution create a chicken that lays so many unfertilized eggs when that is so wasteful?;"Natural evolution did not create a chicken that lays so many unfertilized eggs. Human engineering created such chickens. You could call the process ""human-caused evolution"", ""artificial selection"", or ""selective breeding"". The evolutionary principles of survival of the fittest and inheritance of genetic traits still apply in artificial selection, but the agent that determines who is the fittest is a human and not a natural environmental pressure.";"In selective breeding, humans choose only the individuals of a species that have desirable traits to use as parents for the next generation. After several generations of selective breeding, the organism gains more and more of the desired trait. It's not that the humans are training or teaching the organism to have the desired trait. Rather, genetic mutations cause the next generation of individuals to have a variety of new traits (the ""new traits"" are typically very small modifications when looking at just a single generation). Most of the mutation-caused traits are undesirable or irrelevant. But the few organisms with desirable traits are selected and used to create the next generation.

Organic-food purists may think of words like ""unnatural"", ""unhealthy"", and ""toxic"" when confronted with genetically-modified food. But the fact is that all of our agricultural food has been genetically altered through thousands of years of selective breeding. It does not take a modern biotechnology lab to genetically optimize food for human consumption. All it takes is a farmer choosing the seeds from the juiciest apples, or the hen that lays the most eggs as the progenitor for the next generation. Perhaps without realizing it, humans have been genetic bio-engineers ever since the dawn of agriculture through selective breeding. After many generations over hundreds of years, domesticated chickens have laid more and more eggs per year as a result of humans selecting for this trait. All of the agricultural foods we eat, from wheat and rice to beef and milk, are far more nutrient-rich, delicious, and prolific than their ancient, wild predecessors because of human intervention.";"The next question is perhaps, ""Why do chickens lay unfertilized eggs at all?"" The reason is that the egg is mostly developed before being fertilized. The chicken cannot know in advance whether the egg will end up fertilized or not, so it just has to go ahead and grow the egg in the hopes that it will be fertilized. In the wild, this system works well because mating among fowls is common and most eggs do end up fertilized.";further,service,frequently,cry,animal
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2005;Aug Sep;"Why do camera flashes make your eyes turn red?
";Camera flashes do not make your eyes turn red. The inside of your eyes are always red. The bright light of the camera flash just makes the color more obvious. Your eye is essentially a hollow ball filled with clear fluid. The hole at the front of your eye, the pupil, lets light into the hollow space inside the eye. The light passes through this space and then strikes the inner back surface of the eye, known as the retina. ;"The retina is packed with cells that detect the light, change it to electrical signals, and pass the signals on to the brain where the pattern of light is experienced as a visual image. The approximately 100 million light-sensitive cells on the human retina give us an amazing visual resolution, but they also require a prodigious amount of blood to keep them going. This blood is what gives the retina its red color.

Whenever you look at someone's pupil, you are in fact looking through a hole and at their retina. Because the cavity of the eye acts like a dark cave that absorbs most of the light, the red color of the retina usually looks black under normal lighting conditions. But if the light gets bright enough, the redness of the retina becomes more obvious. The flash of light from a camera is bright enough and angled properly to make the eye's redness more apparent. The result is the all-too-familiar red-eye in photographs. But the camera's flash is doing nothing more special than providing extra light. In fact, you can see the redness of the human retina without a flash or camera. Place a friend close to a regular light bulb such that he is facing the light blub. Now place yourself between the bulb and your friend such that the top of your shadow sits just below his eyes. Now look at his eyes and his pupils will be bright red. For this to work right, the light must be bright and localized (such as a single 100W incandescent light bulb; not a flood light, a shaded light, or a collection of bulbs), other lights must be turned off or blocked (including sunlight), and your friend's pupils need to be widely dilated. You can get his pupils to dilate by turning all lights off for a minute or having him close and cover his eyes for a minute. Upon opening his eyes with the light on, there will be a brief moment before his pupils constrict when you can best see the red eye. If you don't see a very dark, crisp shadow of your head just below his eyes, then the lighting configuration has not been set up properly.";;deeply,third,model,thick,hot
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2011;May Jun;"Why do humans have an appendix even though it is unnecessary?
";"The human cecal appendix is not completely unnecessary. In humans, the appendix is a small, dead-end tube that connects to the colon near where the small intestines feeds into the large intestines. Being a dead-end tube, the appendix can obviously not transport food and waste through the intestinal tract. Furthermore, many people have had their appendix removed and yet seem to suffer no symptoms at all from having no appendix. This fact may seem to indicate that the appendix is useless; an abandoned evolutionary relict of some ancient predecessor. But the appendix turns out to not be completely useless.";"According to a study performed by a team lead by J. H. Grendell of Winthrop University Hospital, people without an appendix were found to experience recurring intestinal C. diff. infections 2.5 times as much as people with an intact appendix. They state, ""The CDI recurrence rate for patients with an appendix was 18%, compared with 45% in those without an appendix."" Additionally, the tissue of the appendix has been found to be rich in active lymphatic follicles similar to those found throughout the intestinal tract. Such lymphatic tissue plays several important biochemical roles in the immune system. In fact, the immune tissue of the appendix has a higher density of immunoglobulin (Ig)A- and IgG-producing immunocytes than the colon. The appendix therefore appears to play a role in the gut's defense against infection.

While the details are not yet fully confirmed by experiment as to how this all works, the line of thinking goes like this: There are typically two kinds of bacteria in the human colon. The bad bacteria destroys tissue and therefore causes infection and disease. The good bacteria does not harm the colon, and in fact benefits humans by keeping the bad bacteria scarce. They do this by beating the bad bacteria in a competition for resources and space. When a person takes antibiotics or experiences an illness that gets rid of the bacteria in the colon, the bad bacteria finds it has the space to get the upper hand. According to this line of thinking, the role of the appendix is to store good bacteria when the colon is being flushed out, so that it can reintroduce the good bacteria into the colon before the bad bacteria takes control. The appendix therefore helps maintain healthy gut flora and is not vestigial. In fact, recent research into the evolution of the appendix has revealed a complex winding path through history that does not fit the old vestigial-structure storyline. H. F. Smith and various collaborators at the University of Arizona have stated,";"""A recently improved understanding of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science, pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies without modern medicine...analyses indicate that the appendix has evolved independently at least twice (at least once in diprotodont marsupials and at least once in Euarchontoglires), shows a highly significant (P < 0.0001) phylogenetic signal in its distribution, and has been maintained in mammalian evolution for 80 million years or longer.""

Note that the fact that the appendix has a purpose in no way disproves evolution or the concept of vestigial structures. There are plenty of other vestigial structures in animals to give these concepts a sound footing. Swimming whales still have leg bones, flightless birds still have wings, various blind cave-dwellers still have eyes, and many slithering snakes still have a pelvis.";behavior,rapidly,model,blue,town
Edexcel;O;4024 - Mathematics D;2007;Oct Nov;"Why do my fingers absorb water and become wrinkled?
";Human finger tips do not become wrinkled because they absorb water. Skin is a fairly good barrier that keeps out most of the external water. If our fingers did absorb a significant amount of water after staying in the pool or bath for several minutes, then our fingers would swell to round, plump shapes, which is the opposite of wrinkling. The wrinkling is actually caused by a reduction of fluid inside the finger tips.;"How can our finger tips experience reduced fluid internally when exposed to increased fluid externally? From a physical perspective, this effect seems to be a paradox. The answer is that the wrinkling of wet finger tips is an active biological response, rather than a passive physical effect. Scientists have known for almost a hundred years that nerve damage in the hand can result in a person no longer being able to get wet-induced finger wrinkles. Finger wrinkling is therefore controlled by the nervous system. Nerve signals cause blood vessels in the finger tips to constrict, reducing the amount of fluid in the finger tips. Just as drying out a grape causes it to turn into a wrinkled raisin, the reduction of fluid in the finger tips causes them to shrivel and wrinkle.

Since finger wrinkling is an active neurological response, it is likely that evolution selected for it because this response confers some type of survival advantage. But how could wrinkles ever help one survive? This question has long been wondered and the answer is still far from settled. However, research done in 2011 seems to hint at an answer. As reported in the journal Brains, Behavior and Evolution, Mark Changizi and his associates at the 2AI Labs found evidence that finger tip wrinkles are shaped to improve the grip of wet fingers. They state, ""We show that their morphology has the signature properties of drainage networks, enabling efficient removal of water from the gripped surface...Wet-induced wrinkles may, in fact, be substantially superior to 'rain treads' on shoes, which maintain a tread even when under compression and thus have a surface area of contact that is reduced. Wet-induced wrinkle treads, on the other hand, are pliable, and the act of pressing a finger tip down on a wet surface 'squeezes' the fluid out from under the finger through the channels, and upon completion of this single pulsatile flow the entire finger's skin contacts the surface."" A human with an improved grip can better handle tools and weapons in the rain, as well as retrieve food from rivers and streams. In this way, the wrinkling of fingers in response to water could have provided a significant survival advantage to our ancestors.";Additional research carried out in 2013 by Kyriacos Kareklas and associates, as reported in Biology Letters, found that participants were able to transfer wet marbles and fishing weights between containers significantly faster if they had wet-induced finger wrinkles. They therefore showed that finger wrinkles indeed improve a human's ability to grip and manipulate wet objects. While more research is needed to confirm these results, these studies suggest that the improved-grip hypothesis is a plausible explanation to wet-induced finger wrinkling.;pay,especially,death,moving,bend

";Swallowed chewing gum does not stay in your system for seven years. Gum, along with anything else inedible, passes from your mouth into the toilet in about a day or two, according to Dr. Michael Picco of the Mayo Clinic. Perhaps this misconception is popular due to the fact that gum is not easily digested and is also sticky.;"But take a sticky wad of half-chewed gum and sprinkle it with water and you'll notice it's not sticky anymore. Once you've swallowed the gum, it's not going to cement itself to your stomach wall because it has lost its stickiness in your stomach juices. If something did get stunk in your digestive track, you wouldn't survive seven years. Within days, stuck food becomes infected and makes you sick. Swallowing gum is about the same as swallowing rocks: they aren't toxic; they will leave your body in a few days; but they might do some damage along the way. Dr. Picco writes ""On rare occasions, large amounts of swallowed gum combined with constipation have caused intestinal blockage in children. It's for this reason that frequent swallowing of chewing gum should be discouraged, especially in children."" A far more dangerous non-toxic item to ingest is a pair of magnets. The magnetic fields themselves don't do any damage directly to your tissue, but the magnetic force between the magnets will cause them to stick together, with your tissue in the middle. And a few drops of water isn't going to turn off that kind of stickiness.";;sitting,determine,official,sister,man
Cambridge;O;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2011;Jan Feb;"Why does every cell in our body contain DNA?
";Not every cell in the human body contains DNA bundled in a cell nucleus. Specifically, mature red blood cells and cornified cells in the skin, hair, and nails contain no nucleus.;"As part of the maturation process, human red blood cells destroy their cell nuclei. They do this in order to carry as much oxygen as possible and still stay small enough to fit through narrow blood capillaries, thereby maximizing the oxygen delivery. In fact, humans have some of the smallest red blood cells of all vertebrates, thanks in part to the destruction of the nucleus. Most mammals have red blood cells without nuclei, while all other types of vertebrates do have nuclei in their red blood cells. However, all red blood cells, including human, must start with DNA, as DNA contains the code that tells each cell how to construct itself in the first place. Human red blood cells simply destroy their nucleus once it is no longer needed as part of the maturation process. A ring of actin within a maturing red blood cell pinches and splits the cell into two parts: one part with the DNA and one part without. Red blood cell enucleation is therefore a special type of cell division. Macrophages then come along and gobble up the parts containing DNA, leaving only the red blood cell parts that don't have DNA. Note that there is much more in blood than red blood cells. As a result, a blood sample does contain DNA due to the presence of other kinds of cells.

Cornified cells in the skin, hair, and nails also contain no cell nucleus. Like red blood cells, these cells start out with cell nuclei in order to develop properly, but then destroy their nuclei as part of the cornification process. They do this in order to maximize the space in the cell filled with the structural protein keratin. Keratin is a strong protein that gives hair, skin, finger nails, and toe nails their toughness. Cells that undergo cornification experience a form of programmed, controlled cell death in order to achieve their strength. The cell nucleus and other internal parts of the cell are destroyed and their space is filled by keratin. Once cornification is complete, these cells are dead and carry out no biochemical processes. But dead does not mean useless. Cornified cells fulfill their end purpose of giving structural strength and warmth to surrounding tissues despite being dead. The fact that cornified cells are dead means that you can cut your hair, clip your nails, and rub off the outer layer of skin without causing any damage or killing cells. The lack of nuclear DNA in cornified cells means that forensic biologists can rarely extract DNA from hair clippings in order to help determine the culprit.";Aside from red blood cells and cornified cells, all other cells in the human body contain nuclear DNA. Also, all cells start with nuclear DNA. The reason for this is that DNA contains the basic code that tells each cell how to grow, function, and reproduce.;push,younger,toward,stand,limited

Cambridge;O;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2021;Oct Nov;"Why don't dogs sweat?
";Dogs do sweat. Sweating is a physiological response to heat where sweat glands secrete salty water. When the water evaporates, it takes energy with it, cooling down the organism in the process. Although dogs don't sweat profusely and visibly the way humans do, they definitely have sweat glands that secrete sweat in response to heat.;"The problem is that most dogs are covered with a thick coat of fur, so sweat secreted where there is fur would get trapped in the fur, fail to evaporate, and therefore fail to cool the dog down much. As a result, it is far more efficient for dogs to have sweat glands where there is little fur. For this reason, most of a dog's sweat glands are located on the pads of its feet and on its nose. On a hot day you may notice a dog leaving behind a trail of wet footprints as it walks across a smooth, dry surface. That's dog sweat.

With far fewer effective places for dogs to have body-cooling sweat glands as compared to humans, dogs must rely on another mechanism to keep cool. The primary cooling mechanism for dogs is panting. By breathing air quickly over the wet surfaces of the inner mouth and lungs, the dog's pants accelerate evaporative cooling in much the same way that a breeze across a sweaty person's skin speeds up cooling. Dogs also have a different kind of sweat gland all over their body. But the sweat emitted from these glands are used to counter rapid rises of temperature in localized skin patches that could lead to burns, and not to cool the body as a whole.";"The Textbook of Small Animal Surgery edited by Douglas H. Slatter states, ""Merocrine glands are coiled, simple, tubular glands found mainly in the footpads of dogs; they empty directly onto the epidermal surface. Sweat glands are better developed in the canine breeds that have long, fine hair. Sweat glands in the hairy skin of dogs and cats [apocrine glands] do not participate actively in the central thermoregulatory mechanism but protect the skin from excessive rise in temperature.""";bell,examine,using,limited,whistle
Cambridge;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2005;May Jun;"Why don't I burst cells in my rear when I sit down?
";You do burst cells when you sit down on broken glass or a pile of pins. The experience is painful and messy. But let's assume you were referring to sitting on a flat chair, in which case you do indeed burst very few of the cells in your body. Why is this? The answer lies in the difference between sitting on broken glass and sitting on a flat chair. When you sit on a flat surface, your entire weight is spread over the large surface area of your rear.;"There are millions of cells per square inch of skin, so the weight that each individual cell experiences when you sit down is actually quite small. This effect is one of the great advantages to having a body made out of very small, self-contained subunits. In contrast, when you sit on an upright pin, much of your weight gets focused to just a handful of cells and they do indeed burst. Sharp objects are so good at cutting because they deliver a moderate total force over a very small area.

Also, the outer layer of your skin is not made of fragile, squishy cells. Instead, most of your outer skin consists of tough dead cells that have been almost completely filled with the strong protein keratin. As part of the cornification process, typical skin cells destroy all of their interior parts, including the nucleus holding the DNA, and fill up with keratin. The destiny of typical skin cells is to die and become hard chunks of protein in order to maintain the tough outer skin layer that protects all the other, more fragile cells deeper inside. Furthermore, skin contains networks of filaments supporting the cells. When you sit down, your weight is felt first by this front line of tough skin cells surrounded by a network of filaments. From there, your weight is distributed to your whole frame by the cushioning effect of the fat and muscle in your rear.";;difficulty,whistle,freedom,giving,brick

";Although the eye's pupil is indeed a hole in the front surface of the eye, this hole is covered in the front by a strong, transparent coating called the cornea and in the back by a fibrous, transparent object called the lens. Also, the space between the cornea and the lens is filled with a gel-like fluid called the aqueous humor. All of these layers form a watertight barrier that seals off the inside of the eyeball from the outside world.;"Fortunately, all of these layers are transparent, so light can still enter our eyes through the pupils, thereby allowing us to see. To ensure that they are transparent, the cornea and lens do not contain any blood vessels. Therefore, nutrients must flow to these tissues through simple diffusion from the aqueous humor.

The layers in front of and behind the pupil do more than keep water out. The cornea, the aqueous humor, and the lens all combine together to act as an optical lens that focuses light into images on the back of the eyeball (the retina). Without these layers, the whole world would look like a non-distinct blur. These layers also seal off the inner eye from microorganisms and dust that could cause infection and damage. Additionally, the inner cavity of the eye is not completely empty. Rather, it is filled with a transparent, gel-like fluid called the vitreous humor. This fluid provides pressure that helps the eyeball keep its shape, much like how filling up a balloon with enough water will help it keep its shape. Even if there were an uncovered hole leading into the eye, the eyeball would not fill up with water when we go swimming because it is already filled with this gel.";;laid,bridge,bell,browserling,whistle
Cambridge;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2017;Oct Nov;"Why don't trees freeze and burst in the winter like cold pipes?
";In many cases, trees do partially freeze in the cold of winter and burst like plumbing pipes in an unheated home. When liquid water freezes to ice, it expands in volume because of the way the water molecules spread out to form a solid crystalline lattice. If the water is contained in a closed vessel, it can press so hard as it freezes and expands that it bursts the container. This explosive effect is common in insufficiently heated houses, where the cold leads the plumbing pipes to burst.;"The fluid transport tissue in trees (xylem and phloem) can be seen as little pipes carrying water and nutrients throughout the tree. They too can freeze and burst, causing the tree to crack and/or explode. The crackling sound or gun-shot pop you hear in the forest in the winter is the sound of trees freezing and bursting. The bursting is usually not as violent or as deadly to the tree as you may first expect for a few reasons. A tree has hundreds to tens of thousands of these fluid channels. If one bursts, the tree has plenty of other ones to rely on. Furthermore, each channel is small, so that an individual channel bursting does not do much damage.

In addition to the fluid channels, each cell of the tree is itself a little bag of water that can pop upon being frozen. If the water inside the cells freeze, it is instantly fatal to the tree. While many trees can withstand freezing of the fluid transport channels outside the cells, none can survive intracellular freezing. Trees that survive in cold climates must therefore protect their cell interiors from freezing. The cold hardiness of trees is caused by many factors:";"Trees are softer and more flexible than metal. As the water in the channels and between cells freezes and expands, the tree's tissue can stretch somewhat instead of bursting.
In preparation for winter, the cells of many trees get rid of a lot of their water content. Less water means less expansion upon freezing. The tree enters a dehydrated, dormant state to survive the winter.
In preparation for winter, some trees produce more sugar. When this sugar dissolves in the water, it lowers the water's freezing point and thus acts like anti-freeze. In maple trees, this sugar-producing winterization can ultimately end up as maple syrup on your pancakes.
Some trees take advantage of supercooling. In supercooling, water can be kept liquid well below its traditional freezing point if there are no nucleation centers for ice crystals to start forming on.";using,independent,were,nearer,still
Cambridge;O;3204 - Bengali;2006;Oct Nov;Why have humans evolved to be taller over the last three hundred years?;Humans have not evolved to be taller in the last three hundred years. While the average adult height has indeed increased in many countries over the last few hundred years, this increase was not caused by evolution. Additionally, the average height gain over the last few hundred years has not been very large. If you have ever taken a tour of a commoner's house that has been preserved in its original state since the 1700's or 1800's, you may have been struck by the uncomfortably low ceilings. You may have concluded, or have been told by a tour guide, that people were generally much shorter hundreds of years ago and didn't need high ceilings. However, this conclusion is misleading. Let's look at this subject more closely.;"First of all, evolution is not the cause of the overall gain in height seen in many countries over the last few hundred years. Biological evolution takes many generations to occur. Humans have a life span of about a century, meaning that human evolution requires thousands to millions of years. A few hundred years is simply not enough time for significant evolutionary changes to come about. Therefore, the small gain in average human height experienced in many countries over the last few hundred years was not caused evolution. The most likely cause is improved nutrition and health. While this subject of study is too complex for scientists to currently draw definite conclusions, the most reasonable explanation is that the overall increase in average height is a reflection of the overall improvement in health. As western civilizations entered the modern age, improved technology made it possible for more and more people to have consistent access to a nutritious diet and a healthy environment. While a person's genetic code may specify the potential height that he can reach once mature, he will fall short of that height if his body does not have adequate health and nutrition. The textbook Height, Health, and History by Roderick Floud, Annabel Gregory, and Kenneth Wachter states, ""it seems safe to say only that the upward trend in European heights reflects the economic development of European nations and the increasing living standards of their populations.""

Now let's look at some numbers. As reported in the book Height, Health, and History, the change in average adult male height in the United States over the last three hundred years did not follow a simple trend. From around 1710 to 1830, the average height of adult American men remained effectively at around 173 cm. Over the next sixty years (1830 to 1890), the average height actually dropped from 173 cm down to 169 cm. Then over the next forty years (1890 to 1930), the average height climbed back up, reaching the value of 176 cm. The average height of adult American men today is still 176 cm.

We can take a few things away from these numbers. First, there has not been a smooth trend in average height change over the last 300 years in the United States. For most of this period, the average height has either stagnated or dropped. Only during the brief forty years leading up to the Great Depression did the average height see rapid increase. Therefore, in the United States, an increase in average height is neither steady nor inevitable.

Secondly, Americans today are not really that much taller than Americans during the 1700's. Three centimeters is less than the diameter of a golf ball. Therefore, a house from the 1700's that has its ceiling three feet too low according to today's standards is not that way because people were three feet shorter back then. Such a house must have been built that way for another reason (perhaps the inhabitants were too poor to afford the extra material for high ceilings).

The last point we can draw from the U.S. height data is that the variation in height among a population at any point in time is much greater than the variation of the average height itself over time. Gather a group of adult males and line them up by height. You will find a variation in height between the shortest one and the tallest of about 20 or 30 cm (if your group is a reasonable statistical sample). Compare this to the 3 cm that Americans have on average gained over the last three hundred years. Simply put, the difference in height between you and your neighbor will likely be several times greater than the difference in height between the average of your neighborhood now and that of your neighborhood three hundred years ago (assuming, for the sake of the argument, that you are all adult American males). In other words, the variation in height from family to family right now is far larger than the variation in average height from century to century. If you time-traveled to the 1700's, you would not notice that the people are shorter on average.";"Now, let's look at Europe. Unlike in the United States, the numbers reported in the book Height, Health, and History indicate that in European nations, the average male height has been changing more steadily. In the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the average male height upon conscription has steadily increased from about 167 cm in 1870 to about 181 cm today. Similarly, in Italy and France, the average male height upon conscription has steadily increased from about 164 cm in 1870 to about 176 cm today. Thus, these European nations have gained about 13 cm in average height over the last 150 years. To give you an idea of what this means, 13 cm is about the width of two tennis balls. As we can see, these European nations did indeed see a more significant gain in height over the last 150 yearsâ€”much larger than that seen in the U.S.â€”but it is still no where near the three foot height gain that some people may have in mind.

We could continue on and look at other countries, but I think we have looked at enough data now to allow us to summarize the main points:

Height changes over the last few hundred years are not caused by evolution.
The changes in average height over the last few hundred years are different from one nation to the next.
In general, humans have indeed been getting taller on average in the U.S. and in many European nations over the last few hundred years, but the overall amount of change has been fairly small (from a few centimeters to a dozen or so centimeters).
The variation in height from one individual to the next is much larger than the change in average height over the last few hundred years.";small,though,up,clean,double

";"Yes. Although rare, there are numerous instances of fish falling down from the skies. Of course, the fish do not really ""rain"" in the sense of condensing out of water vapor. The fish that fall from the sky are just fish that used to be in the sea. So what puts the fish up in the sky in the first place? Although few detailed scientific observations have been performed on this phenomenon, the common consensus is that tornadoes are the culprit.";When tornadoes traverse over bodies of water, they become known as waterspouts. Waterspouts suck up lake or ocean water along with the fish or other creatures swimming in the water. The fish are sucked up the tornado's vortex and then blown around in the clouds until the windspeed decreases enough to let them fall back to the ground, perhaps miles away from where they started. According to Bill Evans' meteorology book titled It's Raining Fish and Spiders, creatures fall from the sky about forty times a year. All sorts of creatures have been reported raining down, including snakes, worms, and crabs, but fish and frogs are the most common. Even squid and alligators have been reported to fall from the sky. Often, the process of being swept high into the clouds encases these creatures in a layer of ice or hail that may still remain after they have plummeted back to earth. Raining creatures encased in blocks of ice can be very dangerous and have been known to smash through car windshields.

Edexcel;A;5070 - Chemistry;2017;May Jun;"Can wind travel faster than the speed of sound?
";Yes, wind can travel faster than the speed of sound. Wind is just the bulk movement of a mass of air through space and is in principle no different from a train speeding along or a comet zipping through space. The only limitation on the bulk motion of objects with mass is the universal speed limit of the speed of light in vacuum. The speed of sound is not a fundamental speed like the speed of light is. ;The speed of sound just describes how fast a mechanical wave travels through a material. Different materials have different speeds of sound. Wind speed and the speed of sound are completely different things. Wind speed is the speed of a chunk of air moving relative to a stationary, external observer. Wind speed is therefore frame dependent. On the other hand, the speed of sound is the speed of a vibrational wave inside a material relative to that material, and is therefore not frame dependent. If you pick your frame of reference right, you can get wind traveling at nearly the speed of light. For instance, air in your living room that is stationary with respect to you and the earth is also wind traveling at incredible speed relative to the center of our galaxy. Air on the International Space Station is traveling about 20 times the speed of sound relative to earth, and yet the astronauts in the space station can talk just fine and send sound back and forth through this air. With that said, large gusts of wind on earth's surface do not typically travel anywhere near as fast as sound.;So what would happen if wind traveled faster than the speed of sound? In isolation, not much. Wind traveling faster than the speed of sound in isolation is still just wind. But, if that supersonic wind hits a stationary object, it will create a sonic boom and knock that object forcefully. A jet flying faster than the speed of sound through stationary air is identical to wind blowing faster than the speed of sound past a stationary jet. In both cases, the same sonic boom is created. In fact, this equivalence is the operating principle behind wind tunnels. Wind going faster than the speed of sound and hitting stationary trees, houses, and rocks would create sonic booms. Note that if there really were large, sustained, weather-caused winds that were going faster than the speed of sound relative to the ground, you would have a lot more to worry about than the sound of the sonic booms. The speed of sound in air is about 750 miles per hour (340 m/s). Sustained wind speeds above 60 miles per hour are enough to uproot trees, knock down buildings, and throw cars around.;should,sky,congress,copper,again
Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2012;Jan Feb;"Clouds are just water vapor, so why do they move?
";Clouds are not water vapor. Water vapor is the gas state of H2O and is invisible. The air around you on a humid summer day is chock full of water vapor, but you don't see any of it. On the other hand, there is very little water vapor in the air during the cold of winter, yet you can easily make clouds with your breath.;"Clouds are collections of liquid water droplets or ice that are small enough to float. When the water vapor in the air gets cold enough, it condenses back into liquid in the forms of droplets. But the condensation is not automatic. It takes a bit of matter â€“ a condensation nucleus â€“ in order to jump start the process. Dust, salt, and ice in the air do the trick by providing a surface for the water to condense on to, according to the book ""Cloud Physics"" by Louis J. Battan. Clouds are white because the water droplets making the cloud are the right size to scatter light resonantly according to Mie scattering. Mie scattering does not depend on wavelength, so all colors get reflects. Humans experience a mix of all colors as white. When the water droplets of the cloud get too big, their weight overcomes the cloud's buoyancy and the drops begin falling as rain. Drops that are big enough to fall as rain are also big enough to scatter light geometrically and not according to Mie scattering. We see such drops as clear. Returning back the original question, clouds can move because wind can blow water droplets around.";;plural,death,feel,means,product
Edexcel;A;2281 - Economics,;2005;Aug Sep;"Do I weigh less on the equator than at the North Pole?
";Yes, you weigh less on the equator than at the North or South Pole, but the difference is small. Note that your body itself does not change. Rather it is the force of gravity and other forces that change as you approach the poles. These forces change right back when you return to your original latitude. In short, a trip to the equator is not a viable long-term weight-loss program.;"Your weight is the combination of all the large-scale, long-term forces on your body. While the earth's gravity is by far the strongest large-scale force, it is not the only one. What you experience as ""something pulling you down"" is actually the total of all the forces and not just gravity. The four dominant large-scale, long-term forces are:

The earth's gravity
The sun's gravity
The moon's gravity
The earth's centrifugal force
Note that although earth's Coriolis force plays a major role in shaping hurricanes and ocean currents, since it is not a static force, it does not contribute to your overall weight. Also, additional forces appear when you ride a roller-coaster, an elevator, a swing, or another vehicle, but these forces are transient, so they do not contribute to your overall, long-term weight. Finally, electromagnetic and nuclear forces are either too small-scale, or too short-term to contribute to your overall weight.

For our purposes, we want to consider the forces that differ significantly at the equator versus the poles. While the sun's gravity is strong enough to keep us and the earth in orbit, the sun's position relative to a spot on the equator versus the poles is constantly changing. As a result, averaged over a few days, the gravitational force of the sun on a spot on the equator is the same as the gravitational force of the sun on a spot on the poles. The same situation applies to the moon. This leaves only earth's gravity and earth's centrifugal force as the two forces that contribute to your weight differing at the equator versus the poles.

As we learned in high school, earth's gravity is approximately constant all over the surface of the earth. But this is only an approximation. If the earth were perfectly spherical and if its density were perfectly uniform, then the strength of earth's gravity would be exactly constant at all points on its surface. But it's not. There are three major complications to earth's gravitational field. First the earth is not a sphere. The earth is spinning, causing it to slightly flatten like a pizza crust thrown and spun in the air. As a result, the earth is an oblate spheroid and not a perfect sphere. If you stand at sea level on the equator, you are 6378 km from the center of the earth. In contrast, at each pole, you are only 6357 km from the center of the earth. Since the strength of gravity weakens as you get farther away from a gravitational body, the points on the equator are farther and have weaker gravity than the poles. The other two complications to earth's gravitational field; non-uniform internal density and local surface mass variations such as mountains; are small enough factors that we will neglect them here. Therefore, assuming the entire mass of the earth is located at its center, we can calculate the force of earth's gravity at the equator and at the poles. Using Newton's law of gravity, we find that the force of earth's gravity on your body at the equator is 9.798 m/s2 times the mass of your body, whereas at the poles it is 9.863 m/s2 times the mass of your body.

The earth's centrifugal force also varies with latitude. The centrifugal force is the outward force felt whenever you are in a rotating reference frame. While the centrifugal force is a non-fundamental force caused ultimately by the inertia of bodies, it is very real for the body in a rotating reference frame, such as your body on the surface of the rotating earth. The centrifugal force is proportional to the tangential speed of the rotating reference frame. The equator is moving quickly as the earth's spins, so it has a lot of centrifugal force. In contrast, the poles are not spinning at all, so they have zero centrifugal force. Since centrifugal force points outwards from the center of rotation, it tends to cancel out a little bit of earth's gravity. If the earth were not spinning, you would be heavier as you would feel the full force of gravity. Since there is more centrifugal force at the equator to cancel gravity, your overall weight at the equator versus at the poles is even less. The centrifugal force on your body at the equator is 0.034 m/s2 times the mass of your body. The centrifugal force at the poles is zero.";Your total weight at sea level at the equator (gravity minus centrifugal force) is therefore 9.764 m/s2 times your mass, whereas your weight is 9.863 m/s2 times your mass at the poles. If we use a more accurate model (such as taking into account the shape of the continents) these numbers will be slightly different, but the overall point will be the same: you weigh about 1% less at the equator than at the poles. If you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kg) at the North Pole, you will weigh 198 pounds (89.8 kg) at the equator. Note that we have focused on the equator and the poles as the extremes, but the same effect applies to all latitudes. You weigh slightly less in Mexico City than in New York City, as Mexico City is closer to the equator.;golden,cap,sets,personal,studied
Edexcel;A;2210 - Computer Science;2013;May Jun;"Does the back of a rainbow look the same as its front side?
";A rainbow does not have a back side. If you were to walk completely to the other side of the mist cloud that is creating the rainbow and turn around, you would not see a rainbow. You have to realize that a rainbow is not a stationary physical object. Instead, it is a pattern of light that becomes a stable image only when you look at it from the right angle. You may not have noticed it, but every time you look directly at the center of a rainbow, the sun is directly behind your head. This is the only angle at which the light pattern that constitutes the rainbow can enter your eye and therefore lead you to see it.;The sun is always in the opposite part of the sky from the center of the rainbow. This is because a rainbow is actually just sunlight which has been refracted and reflected. Refraction occurs when the sunlight enters and leaves the small spherical water droplets that constitute the mist. This refraction is what causes the rainbow's spread of colors and arching shape. However, the overall location of the rainbow is determined mostly by the step in the process where the sunlight is reflected off of the inner back surface of the water droplets. The sunlight that reflects only once off the inner back side of the mist droplets is what constitutes the primary rainbow. Additionally, a small amount of the sunlight reflects twice off the inner back surface. This light consequently comes out of the mist droplet at a slightly different angle, leading to the secondary bow. The secondary bow is always there, but it is so dim that humans can only see it during clear viewing conditions. This second reflection only changes the light's direction a small amount. As a result, both the primary bow and the secondary bow can only be seen when looking away from the sun. Furthermore, neither one can be seen from the back side, i.e. when looking toward the sun.;"This point brings up other interesting questions. Can't some of the sunlight pass through the back side of the water droplet without being reflected? Wouldn't this light be visible from behind the rainbow? The answers are yes and yes. Although it is only a small amount, some of the sunlight that enters a mist droplet indeed continues through the back side without being reflected. Therefore, if you were to walk to the other side of the cloud of mist that is creating the rainbow and turn around, you would indeed see a pattern of light (if the viewing conditions are favorable). However, it would not be a rainbow. It would be a pattern called an ""atmospheric solar corona"", as shown below. A solar corona still includes an arcing shape and a spread of colors, but the size and color sequence of a solar corona are different that of a rainbow. Since most of the sunlight that enters the mist droplet is reflected and not transmitted through, rainbows are very bright and common while solar coronas are dim and rare. Additionally, since you are behind the rainbow, you are now looking directly toward the sun. The sun's glare therefore makes it hard to see the solar corona.";shut,room,pleasant,applied,rabbit
Edexcel;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2021;Oct Nov;"Does wasting household water remove it from the water cycle?
";"No, wasting household water does not ultimately remove that water from the global water cycle, but it does remove it from the portion of the water cycle that is readily accessible and usable by humans. Also, ""wasting"" water wastes the energy and resources that were used to process and deliver the water.";"Parents, city officials, and environmentalists seem to be often telling us, ""Don't waste water!"" and ""Conserve water!"". By these statements they typically mean that we shouldn't leave the faucet on needlessly, should fix all the plumbing leaks right away, and should only use water sparingly. At the same time, our science teachers tell us that all of the water on the earth is part of an ongoing global water cycle. They tell us that water that goes down the drain does not get destroyed. Rather, it just moves on to the ocean and on to the next part of the water cycle. There seems to be a contradiction between these two positions. How can we ""waste"" water, if it just continues on in the water cycle and inevitably makes its way back for us to use again?

The answer is that humans need accessible fresh liquid water to survive, which is only a small subsection of the overall water cycle. When city officials tell you to not waste water, they mean that you should not needlessly divert water from the human-usable part of the water cycle to the non-human-usable part of the water cycle. According to the book ""Water in Crisis"" edited by Peter H. Gleick, only 0.77% of the water on the earth is in the form of fresh, liquid water in and on the ground. The rest is in salty oceans and lakes, locked up as ice, or in the atmosphere. Letting water run down the sink while you grab a snack typically sends that water right out of the part of the water cycle that is accessible and usable by humans. With this in mind, wasting water does not directly hurt the global environment, since the water is not destroyed. Rather, wasting water hurts humans, as it leaves them with less accessible, usable water. Additionally, wasting too much water can hurt the local environment as it drains too much usable water away from the natural ecosystem.

Wasting water does not always hurt humans or the environment. In areas where there are few humans but large amounts of usable water, you can't really ""waste"" water because new water arrives into the human-accessible portion of the water cycle faster than you can send it back out. For instance, consider a remote cabin that is situated in a temperate mountainside forest and that draws its water directly from the ground using a private well. People in such a cabin can't really waste water. They can leave their faucets on all day if they want and they won't be affecting the environment or other humans much. They may not be wasting the water, but they are wasting the electricity that is used to pump the water up from the ground.

In contrast, in areas that have a lot of humans (e.g. cities and suburbs) or very little usable water (e.g. deserts), wasting water can impact the environment and the humans. In regions of the world that are both densely populated and arid, wise use of available water resources is critical to human survival. The identification of what exactly constitutes the wise use of available water resources is really more of a political issue and a personal moral issue than a scientific one, and therefore is best left to the policy makers and to personal opinion. Let us instead focus here on the science.

What is the human-usable portion of the water cycle? The answer is: fresh liquid water on or near the surface of the earth. Humans cannot survive drinking salt water, so pumping untreated water directly in from the oceans and from salt lakes is not an option. It's true that salty ocean water can be converted to fresh water through distillation or reverse osmosis, but these processes are relatively costly so that they are not economically feasible in most parts of the world. For most regions, the ocean is simply not a viable source of human-usable water. Similarly, water in the atmosphere is not a reasonable source of water for human consumption. While the water in the air and in the clouds is fresh water, it is widely dispersed and is hard to collect. Humans must therefore wait for the water in the oceans to evaporate into the atmosphere and then rain or snow back down to the ground. The places near or on the surface where rainwater and snowmelt collect are the places that constitute the human-usable portion of the water cycle. These places include freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and groundwater.";"Note that there are two parts that affect how much usable water can reach human households: 1. the amount of human-usable water available in the local environment, and 2. the capacity of the human-built infrastructure to process and deliver the water. Even though fresh water may be plentiful in a certain region, it may still need to be cleaned of dirt, microbes, and minerals; and then pumped through pipes to the buildings. For this reason, an area may have abundant water resources but may still have to be careful about conserving water if it has inadequate infrastructure. For instance, a small town on a large river may provide water to all the residents of the town by treating and pumping water from the river. Although such a small town may never be able to deplete the river's water, no matter how much water the townspeople waste, the water use rate of the residents may exceed the rate at which the town's system can clean and deliver the water. In such a case, the residents will still have to be careful not to waste water, even though there is plenty of water in the river. In this way, natural human-usable water resources and human-built infrastructure determine whether it is possible for residents to ""waste"" water (i.e. whether it is possible to divert water too quickly to the non-human-usable portion of the water cycle). Even if there is plenty of water in the local system so that ""wasting"" water itself is not really possible, over-use of water can still be a waste of the energy and resources that was used to process and deliver the water.";man,riding,pay,actual,planning
Cambridge;AS;5054 - Physics;2011;Jan Feb;How can there be clouds in winter when it is too cold for water to stay a vapor?;First of all, clouds are never made out of water vapor. Water vapor is invisible because its molecules are too far apart to optically scatter light. Whenever you see steam, mist, fog, or clouds, you are seeing small drops of liquid water or crystals of ice, and not water vapor. The water drops or ice crystals in the air are usually too small for you to see them individually, so instead you see a white or gray haze.;"For instance, with every breath you exhale, you are blowing out water vapor that has evaporated from your lungs. You don't usually see your breath because the vapor you exhale stays in the gas state. But when the air outside is cold enough, the water vapor you breath out quickly condenses to little drops of liquid water and you see your breath as a small could.

Secondly, clouds are not always drops of liquid water. Clouds can also be composed of ice crystals. In fact, the same cloud can be partly composed of water drops and partly composed of ice crystals. Clouds have no problem existing in the cold of winter, because they can just exist as ice crystals. In fact, even in the summer some of the clouds you see are composed of ice crystals. A lot of the rain drops we experience in the summer started their existence high in the sky as snowflakes but melted before reaching us. When the water drops get high enough in the sky, they encounter the colder temperatures at higher altitudes and freeze, even in the summer. Both water drops and ice crystals in a cloud are so small that they both look like white fluff from the ground. You usually can't tell the difference between a water cloud and an ice cloud just by looking at it. But there is a difference. Water drops are mostly spherical, while ice is crystalline with flat surfaces. This difference in shape means that the types of bows they create are different. Water droplets in the air create rainbows, while ice crystals create sundogs, halos, and arcs.

Thirdly, water can exist as a liquid in winter, even below its freezing point, if there are no nucleation centers. Sub-freezing liquid water is called supercooled water. In order for liquid water to condense to a solid, it has to be cold enough and have somewhere to freeze onto. All it takes is a bit of dust or even vibrations to kick start crystallization. But in certain situations in the atmosphere, such nucleation centers are sometimes hard to come by. As a result, the water can stay liquid below freezing temperatures.";Lastly, even when the air near the ground is at freezing temperatures in the winter, there are still often layers of atmosphere higher up that are warm enough for water to stay liquid.;song,not,town,aboard,adventure
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2021;Oct Nov;"How do geologists use carbon dating to find the age of rocks?
";"Geologists do not use carbon-based radiometric dating to determine the age of rocks. Carbon dating only works for objects that are younger than about 50,000 years, and most rocks of interest are older than that. Carbon dating is used by archeologists to date trees, plants, and animal remains; as well as human artifacts made from wood and leather; because these items are generally younger than 50,000 years. Carbon is found in different forms in the environment â€“ mainly in the stable form of carbon-12 and the unstable form of carbon-14. Over time, carbon-14 decays radioactively and turns into nitrogen.";"A living organism takes in both carbon-12 and carbon-14 from the environment in the same relative proportion that they existed naturally. Once the organism dies, it stops replenishing its carbon supply, and the total carbon-14 content in the organism slowly disappears. Scientists can determine how long ago an organism died by measuring how much carbon-14 is left relative to the carbon-12.

Carbon-14 has a half life of 5730 years, meaning that 5730 years after an organism dies, half of its carbon-14 atoms have decayed to nitrogen atoms. Similarly, 11460 years after an organism dies, only one quarter of its original carbon-14 atoms are still around. Because of the short length of the carbon-14 half-life, carbon dating is only accurate for items that are thousands to tens of thousands of years old. Most rocks of interest are much older than this. Geologists must therefore use elements with longer half-lives. For instance, potassium-40 decaying to argon has a half-life of 1.26 billion years and beryllium-10 decaying to boron has a half-life of 1.52 million years. Geologists measure the abundance of these radioisotopes instead to date rocks.";;tightly,silly,congress,toward,personal
Edexcel;O;7707 - Accounting;2015;Jan Feb;"How do icebergs lose their salt?
";Icebergs do not have any salt to begin with. Icebergs are not pieces of frozen ocean water. Rather, icebergs are frozen chunks of fresh water that began their life on land. It all starts when snow falls in a region of land that is too cold for the snow to melt. Over time, the non-salty snow builds up on the ground. Without temperatures warm enough to melt the snow, it piles up so high that it starts to crush under its own weight.;"The crushing force of gravity fuses the non-salty snow crystals into a giant slab of non-salty ice known as a glacier. This process is very slow and takes a long time. Gravity not only pulls the snow down into the ice, it also pulls the ice downhill. Often ""downhill"" means ""towards the ocean"". Very slowly, the giant slab of ice slides downhill to the ocean. Once it reaches the ocean, it just keeps going like a train with no brakes. A glacier is so big that just the very edge of it slides out over the ocean. Because ice floats on water, the edge of a glacier has no problem just sitting there, floating on the ocean.

But eventually, the glacier slides too far out over the ocean, stretches from the movement, and cracks on the edges. Warm temperatures can also speed up the cracking process. Once the crack is deep enough, pieces of the glacier break away and drift out into the open ocean. A new iceberg is born. Note that this explanation may make it sound like a one time event. In reality, each glacier is continually forming, flowing, and cracking. One end of a glacier up in the mountains is forming from the new snow, while at the same time, the other end is cracking over the ocean and making icebergs. Because the glacier is very deep, the iceberg chunks that break off are very tall. The word ""iceberg"" literally means ""ice mountain"" in Germanic languages, signifying their height. In contrast, frozen ocean water forms thin flat sheets called pack ice. In summary, non-salty snow turns into non-salty glacier ice on land, which breaks into non-salty icebergs over the ocean.";;anyway,friendly,iron,personal,iron
Edexcel;O;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2020;Jan Feb;"How do wells get their water from underground rivers?
";Most wells do not get their water from underground rivers, but instead get the water from aquifers. Aquifers are layers of rock and soil with water flowing through their small pores. For the most part, there are not giant caves under earth's surface containing violent rivers of water flowing quickly through them. Instead, groundwater drips slowly and gently through the small spaces within rocks, between rocks, and between loose materials such as sand and gravel. In fact, water in aquifers can take years to centuries to flow back to the surface, as shown in the figure. A typical flow rate for water in aquifers is ten feet per year. For this reason, if a region experiences no rain for a few weeks, the wells will not immediately run dry.;"New water, such as from rain or melting snow, drips down into the ground through the pores and cracks in the rocks and soil. Some of the water sticks to the dirt and rocks close to the surface and some of it continues to drip downward. The layer of ground just below the surface is a mixture of rock, soil, water, and air bubbles. When gravity pulls the water in the ground deep enough, it fills all of the possible pores and cracks, forcing the air bubbles up. At this depth, the ground becomes saturated with water. The boundary between the unsaturated ground and the saturated ground is called the water table. The exact location of the water table depends on how much new water there is, how quickly the water is flowing away, and how permeable the ground is.

If you dig a hole into the ground that ends above the water table, most of the water at this depth is stuck to bits of soil and rock, so that little water empties out into your hole. In contrast, if you dig a hole deep enough that it ends below the water table, the water in the saturated ground is pulled by gravity into the empty space at the bottom of the hole. In this case, your hole fills up with water that drips out of the holes in the rocks. But the water only fills up your hole up to the level of the water table (slightly lower actually). For water in your hole to go higher than the water table, it would have to flow up instead of down, which is not how gravity works. A ""well"" is simply a hole dug deep enough that it penetrates below the water table and therefore fills up with water. To retrieve the water, old wells used simple buckets on ropes. More modern wells use pumps that suck the water up the hole. Pumps can be driven manually by hand action, by an attached windmill, or by an electric motor. When digging a new well, you don't have to locate an underground river. You just have to dig deep enough that you reach below the water table.";Something interesting can happen if a layer of impermeable rock sits above a layer of water-filled permeable rock, and if the impermeable rock slopes downward. The water flowing in the lower level gets trapped by the impermeable upper level, creating a confined aquifer. As the water flows downward with no outlet, pressure builds. If a hole is dug into the ground deep enough that it reaches a confined aquifer, the pressure can be great enough to shoot water up the well without any help from a pump. Such a well is called a flowing artesian well.;citizen,fell,enjoy,not,regular
Cambridge;AS;2210 - Computer Science;2021;Jan Feb;"How does a cloud fill up with water?
";Strictly speaking, a cloud does not fill up with water. First of all, a cloud is not a sponge made out of some other material which soaks up water. The water in a cloud is the cloud. More accurately, a cloud consists of very small liquid water drops or ice crystals suspended in air. The water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud are floating not because they are soaked up by some sponge-like material that is holding them in place. Rather, the water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud float because they are so small that the air resistance balances out gravity.;"To be more precise, the water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud do not actually float motionless in the sky. Rather, they are constantly falling very slowly under the influence of gravity and are occasionally lofted upwards by an updraft of wind. This falling and updrafting motion of the drops/crystals that make up a cloud is so slow, and clouds are so big and far away, that it is hard for a casual human observer on the ground to notice this motion. The book ""Cloud Physics"" by Louis J. Battan states, ""A droplet of 10-micron radius falls at a speed of 1 cm/sec [0.02 mph], while droplets of 50-micron radius fall at a speed of 26 cm/sec [0.6 mph]."" When the drops of liquid water or ice that make up a cloud increase in size through collisions and coalescence, they can get so big that the air resistance can no longer counter gravity (when r > 0.1 mm). Such droplets fall down as rain.

Secondly, clouds are not full of water. They are mostly full of air. When we say a bucket is filled with water, we mean that just about every available space in the bucket contains water. In a cloud, every available space definitely does not contain water. The water making up a cloud falls down as rain long before it coalesces enough to fill the entire volume of a cloud. Amazingly, only one billionth of the volume of a cloud consists of water. The rest is air. This means that for every one cubic nanometer of a cloud containing water, there are about a billion cubic nanometers in the cloud that contain just air. The book ""Color and Light in Nature"" by David K. Lynch and William Charles Livingston states, ""Despite their impressive visibility, clouds are tenuous beings. A cumulus may have 1000 droplets per cubic centimeter, but these drops are minute and comparatively widely spaced. Water makes up less than one billionth (10-9) of the cloud's apparent volume and contributes only about one millionth of a gram per cubic centimeter to its density."" Clouds are definitely not full of water. They are mostly full of air.

How can clouds be so visually striking when they are mostly invisible air? The key is that light reflects off the surface of objects. The more surface area, the more that light gets reflected. It is the same reason that pure solid ice is mostly clear but snow (which is just ice in small complex shapes) is bright white. While a cloud does not contain a lot of water in terms of total volume, the water it does contain is divided among trillions of small droplets, leading to many reflecting surfaces.

For example, assume for simplicity that a cloud consists of water droplets that are all the same size with radius r and are distributed uniformly. Suppose the total volume of the cloud is fixed at Vcloud and the total volume of the water in this cloud is fixed at Vw. Since the volume of a single spherical drop of water is 4/3 Ï€ r3, the number of drops n in the cloud times this drop volume gives us the total water volume in the cloud: Vw = n 4/3 Ï€ r3. Similarly, the surface area of one sphere is 4 Ï€ r2, so the total droplet surface area in the whole cloud is Atotal = n 4 Ï€ r2. Solving the volume equation for n and substituting the result into the area equation, we find: Atotal = 3Vw/r. Since the total water volume is fixed, this equation tells us that as the radius of each drop goes down, the total droplet surface area goes up, as shown in the graph below. For small cloud droplet sizes, the total cloud droplet surface area jumps up to very high values. Since the amount of the light reflected by an object depends strongly on its surface area, the large total cloud droplet surface area allows a cloud to be bright despite being mostly air. Note that as an individual drop shrinks in size, its individual surface area of course gets smaller. But for a fixed total volume of water in a cloud, smaller drops means more drops, which means more total surface area.

";Assuming that the total volume of a cloud and its total water volume are constant, and that the cloud droplets are all the same size, the total droplet surface area of the cloud is inversely proportional to the drop radius, as shown in this plot. Since the amount of light reflected by an object strongly depends on the surface area of the object, we see that the small drop sizes in a cloud produce a huge surface area which reflects a lot of light. In this way, clouds can be bright despite being so empty. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.;whistle,third,though,song,bend
Edexcel;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2005;Oct Nov;"How does diffraction make a tree's shadow blurry?
";Diffraction is not what makes a tree's shadow blurry. The shadows of trees, buildings, and other outdoor objects are made blurry by the fact that the sun is an extended light source. Although diffraction can make shadows blurry, for human-sized objects at visible wavelengths of light, the diffraction of light is small.;"Look closely at the shadow of a tree cast on the grass, your hand cast on the sidewalk, or a fence cast on a distant wall. Each shadow has the general shape of the object casting the shadow, but the edges of the shadows are not crisp. Rather, the edges of the shadow are blurry or fuzzy. The farther away the shadow is from the object creating the shadow, the more blurry the shadow becomes. For instance, move your hand away from its shadow on the sidewalk, and the shadow becomes more of a blob. If light traveled only in perfectly straight lines and there were only point sources of light, all shadows would be perfectly crisp because the light would reach a spot and then not reach a spot right next to it. There are therefore two effects that blur out shadows: 1) light does not travel only in straight lines, but can bend around corners (""diffraction""), and 2) light does not come only from point sources.

The sun is not a point source of light. Rather, the sun has an extended shape with a finite width. Light generated by the sun emanates from different points in space along the sun's surface. This concept can be better understood by looking at the diagram below. Light from one side of the sun can reach the areas that are shadowed from the light of the other side of the sun. Similarly, light from the other side of the sun can reach the areas that are shadowed from other light rays. Light from an extended object is able to penetrate the shadow region because the light comes from different points along the sun. If the shadowing object is close enough to the surface on which the shadow is cast (e.g. the ground), there is an area of shadow where no light from the sun can reach. This inner, darker region of the shadow is called the ""umbra"". (The word ""umbra"" comes from Latin and means ""shade"". It is also the root of the word ""umbrella"", which shades you from sunlight or rain. This connection between the two words can help you remember what ""umbra"" means.) The outer, lighter region of the shadow is the area where some of the sunlight is able to reach, making the shadow lighter. This lighter part of the shadow is called the ""penumbra"". (The word ""penumbra"" comes from Latin roots which mean ""almost shadow"", similar to how the word ""peninsula"" comes from roots which mean ""almost island"".) As you go towards the outer regions of the penumbra, more and more light of the sun is able to reach the ground, and the shadow grows lighter and lighter. Every object illuminated by the sun can cast a shadow with an umbra and a penumbra just like astronomical objects can. The blurry edges of everyday shadows are caused by the light sources being extended objects. Light from different parts of the source are able to travel into the shadow area because they emanate from different points in space. The darker, inner part of the shadow where no light can reach is called the ""umbra"". The lighter, outer part of the shadow, where some light can reach is called the ""penumbra"". The parts where all the light can reach are unshadowed. Everyday objects illuminated by sunlight, such as trees and fences, can cast shadows composed of an umbra and penumbra just like astronomical objects. Note that this image is only a schematic diagram and nothing is to scale. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
Interestingly, if a light source is more extended in one direction than the other, then the shadows associated with this light source will be more blurry in one direction than the other. For instance, look closely at the shadow of your hand in a room at night with only a single, long, fluorescent light bulb turned on. Holding your hand in one direction, the tips of your fingers in the shadow will be sharp while the sides of your fingers will be blurry. Now rotate your hand ninety degrees, and the finger tips will become blurry while the finger sides become sharp. Similarly, the sun can also cause this effect. Right before sunset, the sun's light is squashed into a flattened disc by atmospheric refraction. The light from the sun near sunset therefore acts like it came from a light source that is more extended in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction. Looking closely at the shadow of your hand near sunset, you can see that it is more blurry in the horizontal direction than the vertical, proving that the blurry nature of everyday shadows is caused by the sun being an extended source.";Diffraction can also cause shadows to be blurry, but the effect is more rare in everyday life (stated more carefully: diffraction itself is common in everyday life, but diffraction causing the blurriness of shadow edges is less common). Diffraction is a wave effect where waves are able to bend around the corners of obstructions. First of all, diffraction is a weak effect that depends on the wavelengt of light. The wavelength of visible light is on the order of hundreds of nanometers. As a result, simple edge diffraction, such as would make shadow edges blurry, happens on a very small scale. Diffraction effects can be amplified if very small structures are used, such as diffraction gratings or fog droplets. But at that point, you are not really producing shadows anymore, but are producing complex diffraction patterns. As far as shadows go, the diffraction effects of everyday objects on visible light are largely too weak to notice. Secondly, diffraction is a coherent effect that typically requires a nearly monochromatic beam such as a laser beam in order to become significant. Sunlight contains many colors that all diffract differently, so that the net effect, as far as shadows are concerned, is that the diffraction effects wash each other out.;plus,younger,coast,model,energy
Cambridge;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2011;Oct Nov;"How does trash in the ocean disappear?
";Much of the trash in the ocean does not disappear, and this is becoming a big problem. Biodegradable materials such as paper, cardboard, and food quickly disintegrate, degrade, and are eaten by microorganisms in the ocean. However, materials such as plastic, glass, and metal do not degrade as well. Glass and metal tend to be heavy enough that they sink to the bottom of the ocean, out of sight. On the other hand, most plastic objects float on the surface of the ocean.;"Over time, ocean currents either wash this floating trash ashore or sweep it into big patches of garbage in the middle of the oceans.

There are many oceanic garbage patches across the globe. The biggest one lies in the northern Pacific Ocean and is called the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch."" Oceanic garbage patches are formed by the tendency of circulating ocean currents to gather floating debris into the center of the circulating pattern. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch stretches from Japan to California and is densest at two central regions: at a point between Japan and Hawaii and at a point between Hawaii and California. Most of the floating, non-biodegradable trash that makes it to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch stays there. For this reason, the garbage patch is continually growing.

With that said, it's not like there are mountains of recognizable objects sitting in the ocean. The churning motion of the ocean, temperature fluctuations, and the high-energy components of sunlight all tend to steadily break down non-biodegradable trash into small bits. These bits typically range in size from microscopic specks to marbles. They mostly disperse across the surface of the water, forming a thin layer. Some of the plastic bits are also pushed down below the surface by the churning of the water. In addition to the large number of plastic bits spread out across the ocean's surface, there are occasionally larger objects such as sneakers, toothbrushes, and bags that have not yet broken down to smaller bits.";"What collected all this trash into a patch? The ultimate culprits are global ocean currents that are forced to flow in a circulating pattern by earth's rotation. The rotation of the earth creates a force called the Coriolis force. This force acts on everything, but it is usually too weak to notice. Since the Coriolis force is so weak, its effects only become significant when applied to a very large fluid system such as the atmosphere or an ocean. The Coriolis force causes the ocean currents to travel in giant circles; clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. A giant region of circulating ocean currents is called a ""gyre"" and is somewhat like a giant, slowly-moving whirlpool. The continents tend to get in the way, deforming and weakening these gyres. Being the largest span of uninterrupted ocean, the northern Pacific Ocean has one of the largest and strongest patterns of circulating ocean water. The pressure differentials that naturally arise in the circulating water currents of a gyre tend to push floating bits of trash toward the center of the gyre, where the trash accumulates. This trash is harmful to marine life and can even reach humans through the food chain.";salt,stairs,large,soon,double
Edexcel;A;5070 - Chemistry;2018;Aug Sep;"How does water dowsing work?
";In the sense that it finds underground water, water dowsing does not work. Water dowsing involves the claim that a person can locate underground sources of water without using any scientific instruments. Typically, the person that is dowsing holds sticks or rods and walks around a property in the hopes that the rods will dip, twitch, or cross when he walks over the underground water. The dowsing rods do indeed move, but not in response to anything underground. They are simply responding to the random movements of the person holding the rods. The rods are typically held in a position of unstable equilibrium, so that a small movement gets amplified into a big movement.;"The movements of the rods do not seem like they are coming from the small vibrations in the dowser's arms, since these vibrations are so small and the rod's movements are so large. From the false assumption that the movements of the rods are not coming from the small random vibrations of the dowser's arms, people then make the illogical leap that the movements must therefore be caused by something powerful that is out of sight, i.e. underground water. Since successfully locating underground water can save a farmer the trouble of digging several wells that end up dry, and since scientific approaches can be expensive, there is a strong incentive for people to want water dowsing to work.

Unstable equilibrium describes a state where all the forces on an object cancel out but the slightest deviation from the point of equilibrium causes the object to fly off. For instance, if you place a marble on exactly the top edge of a sharply-ridged roof, the marble will sit there motionless since the forces pulling it down either side of the roof cancel out. However, if the slightest breeze blows past the marble, it will give the marble a small bump toward one side of the roof. The forces will no longer cancel and the marble will shoot down one side of the roof. Since the marble was in a state of unstable equilibrium, gravity was able to amplify a small movement invisible to humans (the bump from the gentle breeze) into a large movement (the marble rolling down the side of the roof). To the naked human eye, it looks like a power agent exists only on one side of the house and is drawing the marble towards it. If we didn't understand the concept of unstable equilibrium, we may be tempted to say that there is underground water only on the one side of the house which pulled the marble down that side. Belief in water dowsing operates on this type of misunderstanding.

In many areas of the world, water dowsing seems to really work. In such areas, the location that the dowser points out indeed leads to a productive well. However, such areas of the world have so much groundwater close to the surface that any location will yield a productive well. The situation is like filling a box with only green socks and then asking a magician to close his eyes and use his magic powers to find a green sock in the box. If a system is secretly rigged for 100% success from the start, any method we use will seem successful. The U.S. Geological Survey states, ""The natural explanation of â€˜successful' water dowsing is that in many areas underground water is so prevalent close to the land surface that it would be hard to drill a well and not find water. In a region of adequate rainfall and favorable geology, it is difficult not to drill and find water!""

The belief in dowsing typically involves the misunderstanding that underground water consists of large underground rivers flowing through caverns. In this thinking, one spot on a farm would be a good location to drill a well because it is lined up with the underground river, whereas another spot 20 feet away would be a bad location since it misses the underground river. In reality, most underground water does not flow in rivers but instead flows everywhere through the tiny pores and cracks in the rocks. In any climate that receives a moderate amount of rainfall, you will always hit water if you dig deep enough. Therefore, the question to ask is not, ""What spot on my farm has water underneath it?"" Every spot has water underneath it. The right question to ask is, ""How deep will I have to dig to get below the water table?"" Another important question to ask when drilling a well is, ""Does my ground contain the right kind of rock that will release its water fast enough to fill my well?"" Even if there is water in the ground, a dense rock with small pores may release its water too slowly to be useful.

Various controlled scientific studies over the last hundred years have repeatedly found that water dowsing does not work. For instance, 30 ""expert"" dowsers were invited to Kassel, Germany in 1990 to have their abilities tested in a study organized by James Randi. Pipes carrying flowing water were buried underground at known locations and the dowsers were tested as to their ability to determine if water was flowing through the pipes. All failed to do better than random guessing. In the book Carl Sagan's Universe, edited by Yervant Terzian and Elizabeth Bilson, James Randi describes the tests:";While we were there we designed a series of tests, as I have done in many countries around the world, to test the forked stick or the pendulum or the coat hanger wires or whatever. Some people do it with their hands. And we did it in Kassel, Germany, two years ago, a very definitive set of tests, and, of course, it proved that the law of averages works quite well, but dowsing doesn't.;which,parallel,bell,double,citizen
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2009;May Jun;"How does wind create all the ocean currents?
";Ocean currents are mostly not created by wind. While wind can play a role, often minor, in shaping surface ocean currents, it is not the main or only factor. Furthermore, wind plays virtually no role at all when it comes to deep ocean currents. The main drivers of ocean currents are as follows:;"1. The Coriolis Force.
The rotation of the earth causes two main inertial forces: the centrifugal force pointing straight up (which is mostly swamped out by gravity), and the Coriolis force which points perpendicular to an object's motion. The perpendicular nature of the Coriolis force causes objects in motion to travel in great circles on the surface of the earth. Systems in the northern hemisphere circle clockwise while systems in the southern hemisphere circle counter-clockwise. The Coriolis force is very weak, so it has little effect on which way the water spirals in a sink as it drains. But when a lot of water is involved, such as in the ocean, the Coriolis force plays a large role. Because of the Coriolis force, the major ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to spiral clockwise and they tend to spiral counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. These current patterns can be seen in the image below. The Coriolis force is an inertial force that arises from the earth being in a rotating reference frame. The Coriolis force is not imaginary or fictional, but is simply inertial, meaning that it is very real in the rotating reference frame, but is not fundamental as it arises from the motion of the frame itself.

2. Density Differences.
Fluctuations in both temperature and salt content lead different regions of ocean water to have different densities. Higher temperatures, such as near the equators, cause a given mass of water to expand and therefore drop in density. Also, lower salt content causes a given mass of water to be lower in density. Gravity causes the more dense water to fall, pushing away the less dense water, which shoots sideways and rises. Giant convection loops of ocean currents form as the lighter (hotter, less salty) regions of water rise and flow to replace the heavier (colder, more salty) regions of water. The effect of density-driven currents is fundamentally a result of the interplay heating from the sun, earth's gravity, and salinity differences.

3. Tides.
Differences in the gravitational field of the moon from one location to the next causes tidal forces. Differences in the gravitational field of the sun also causes tidal forces. Tidal forces push water towards the axis connecting the earth and moon, and the axis connecting the earth and sun. The water moves in ocean currents in response to these tidal pushes, causing the well-known daily cycle of high tide and low tide.

4. Shoreline Obstruction.
Although ocean currents are not directly generated by the shoreline, they are certainly shaped by the shoreline. As the water in an ocean current moves forward under the push of the forces listed above, it inevitably runs up against the solid mass of land and is deflected along the shoreline. The above-water shoreline, as well as the shape of the ground under the water's surface (the depth contours), both affect the direction of ocean currents.";;add,brick,small,shadow,west
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2012;Oct Nov;"If I jump, will the entire earth move a little bit?
";It's true that every force has an equal and opposite force. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the earth pushes on you to send you into the air after jumping, you also push on the earth with the same force. But forces are different from accelerations. A force F is a push or pull on an object. The acceleration a is the change in speed of the object that results from the force. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force and resulting acceleration are related according to the equation F = ma, where m is the mass of the object.;"This means that if we hold the force constant, then the bigger the mass, the smaller the acceleration. The mass of the earth is so huge, that the acceleration caused by the force of one person jumping is ridiculously small. It's small, but in this simplified picture, it's not zero. The earth would therefore move a ridiculously small amount when you jump (at least in this simplified picture). To move the earth a noticeable amount, you would need a bigger force, such as a collision with another planet. Even though you have, in principle, moved the earth, the mutual gravitational attraction between you and the earth would quickly bring you back together again. You fall back to the earth and the earth falls back to you, and once you are reunited, any displacement of the earth that you might have created is gone.

This simplified picture would only be true if you were the only object in the world pushing on the earth. In reality, the earth is covered with billions of people and creatures all jumping, walking, bumping, tumbling, or breathing on the surface of the earth at the same time. Being distributed somewhat uniformly over the earth's surface, the forces on the earth from all these creatures tend to cancel each other so that the earth feels no net movement, not even a ridiculously small one. Even if we take into account all the people and creatures in this way, our picture is still too simple to get at the truth.

In reality, the earth is not perfectly rigid. Even the hardest bedrock is somewhat elastic. This means that when you jump, you don't actually exert a force on the entire earth at once. Being elastic, the entire earth does not accelerate all at once away from you when you jump. Instead, you just deform a tiny bit of earth right under your feet. If the ground you are standing on is loose and weak, such as sand or mud, then the deformation caused by jumping only travels a few meters. If you jump while you are standing on bedrock, then the deformation will ripple away for several meters in the form of very weak seismic waves. The seismic waves caused by humans jumping are so weak that they are quickly overpowered by the seismic waves caused by more powerful forces such as ocean waves, wind, and earthquakes. The local earth movements caused by people walking, cars on the highway, a truck rumbling down the road, a train pummeling down the track, etc. are called ""ambient vibrations"" and are considered noise on a seismograph.";The seismic wave created by a person jumping is far too weak to travel all the way to other side of the earth and therefore be considered as having moved the entire earth in any sense of the phrase. A stronger force, such as is due to an exploding nuclear bomb, a volcano that has blown its top, or an earthquake, does create seismic waves that are strong enough to travel to the other side of the earth. But the center of earth does not change in these cases, because the ground is just vibrating and is not permanently displacing.;of,coast,say,failed,plural
Cambridge;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2016;Aug Sep;If I were able to dig a hole from the U.S. through the center of the earth, what part of China would I end up in?;The U.S. is in the northern hemisphere. If you went straight through the earth's center, you would end up in the southern hemisphere, nowhere near China. Take a globe of the earth and rest it on the palm of your hand like a basketball so that the U.S. is touching your palm. The spot on the globe pointing straight up is on the opposite side of the earth from the U.S. and is where you would come up after your brave digging expedition.;"You would end up in the Indian ocean southwest of Australia. If you were very careful, you could start your dig at just the right spot in Canada and end up on the tiny island of Heard in the middle of the ocean. If you were determined to start on one continent and end on another continent, the closest jumping off point would probably be Peru, which would lead you to Malaysia.

If you still have your heart set on surprising the Chinese farmers by surfacing in their fields, your tunnel will have to start in Argentina. Digging such a tunnel is of course hypothetical. The temperature at the center of the earth is 9800Â° F and the pressure is about 4 million times higher than at the surface of the earth, according to D. Alfe in his paper ""The ab inito Simulation of the Earth's Core"". No vehicle or digging machine can withstand those temperatures and pressures using current technology. Even if such a miraculous machine were invented, it would have a long way to go. The English Channel Tunnel spans 31 miles underground and took 6 years to build. At that same rate, a tunnel through the earth would take 1600 years to dig.";;faster,regular,buffalo,pipe,planning
Edexcel;A;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2010;Aug Sep;"Is a quadruple rainbow possible?
";Yes, although very rare, it is possible for a human to see four natural rainbows at once in the sky. A rainbow occurs when white sunlight scatters off of raindrops in the air. Because of the dispersive properties of water, the different colors of light in the sunlight bend (refract) different amounts when entering and leaving the raindrop.;"As a result, the different colors leave the raindrop at different angles, making you see the different colors at different locations in the sky. Because this scattering is a geometric effect that depends on the direction of the original incoming sunlight, the rainbow forms as a circle (or part of a circle) that is centered on the point exactly opposite of the sun. The main rainbow (called the ""primary rainbow"") involves sunlight entering the raindrop, reflecting once off the inner back surface of the raindrop, and then exiting the raindrop.

Additionally, light can bounce twice off the inner surface of the raindrop before exiting. The second reflection causes these light rays to exit at an angle that is very different from that of the light rays that only reflect once. Therefore, a secondary rainbow forms that has a larger radius than the primary rainbow. The secondary rainbow is created by the same sunlight and the same refraction process as the primary rainbow, so it is also centered on the point exactly opposite the sun. Because of the additional reflection, the colors in the secondary rainbow are reversed in order compared to the primary rainbow. Since some light is lost out of the raindrop with every reflection, the secondary rainbow is much fainter than the primary rainbow. In principle, the secondary rainbow is always present. However, the secondary rainbow is often so faint that humans can't see it. When viewing conditions are right (i.e. it is an unusually sunny day and there are an unusually high number of raindrops in the air), the secondary rainbow can be seen quite distinctly.

double rainbow
The primary and secondary rainbows are visible in this photograph. Public Domain Image, source: NASA.
As you may have guessed, light can bounce three times off the inner surface of the raindrop before exiting, creating a third-order rainbow; or bounce four times, creating a fourth-order rainbow; and so on. However, the third-order and higher-order rainbows are so faint that they are almost never seen by the naked eye. By using a camera and image enhancements techniques, the third-order rainbow can indeed be imaged. This task is difficult enough that successfully capturing and analyzing the third-order rainbow earned Michael Grossman, Elmar Schmidt, and Alexander Haussmann a publication in the academic journal, Applied Optics. Considering the near impossibility of seeing third- and fourth-order rainbows, how are people able to see four rainbows in the sky at once?

The answer is that some of the sunlight can be reflected before entering the raindrops. Recall that rainbow formation is a geometric scattering effect leading the rainbow to be centered on the point opposite the sun. What would happen if there were two suns at two different locations in the sky? Then sunlight would hit the raindrops at two different angles, and two primary rainbows would result, each centered on a different point. If viewing conditions are favorable enough that the secondary rainbows are visible, then there would be four rainbows: a primary rainbow and a secondary rainbow centered on the point opposite the one sun, as well as a primary rainbow and a secondary rainbow centered on the point opposite the other sun. On planets with rain and two suns, quadruple rainbows are common. However, we don't have two suns, so why am I mentioning this? A large, flat, shiny surface can reflect enough sunlight that the situation acts like two suns. A calm lake does exactly this. The sunlight coming directly from the sun is at an angle that is different from that of the sunlight reflecting off the surface of a lake, and they therefore form different rainbow sets centered on different points. The rainbows formed from the sunlight coming off of the lake are called ""reflection rainbows"". In summary, although it is very rare, it is possible for the naked human eye to see four natural rainbows at once in the sky, consisting of:

The primary rainbow (single reflection inside the raindrop) from direct sunlight.
The secondary rainbow (double reflection inside the raindrop) from direct sunlight.
The primary rainbow (single reflection inside the raindrop) from lake-reflected sunlight.
The secondary rainbow (double reflection inside the raindrop) from lake-reflected sunlight.";In principle, the naked human eye could see six rainbows if there were two different large reflecting surfaces, creating the effect of three suns. For instance, if a large, flat, smooth glacier was sitting next to a lake and its surface was tilted compared to the lake's surface, then if conditions were just right, you could see six rainbows at once. Although physically possible, this situation is exceedingly rare.;toy,log,poor,them,syllable
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2007;Aug Sep;"What causes the water going down a drain to swirl clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere?
";Water swirling down a drain does not always go a certain direction. You can get the same sink to swirl water clockwise one minute and counter-clockwise the next. This misunderstanding has its basis in a very real effect: the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force is in the same family as the centrifugal force.;"It is an inertial force caused by the rotation of an object. It is not imaginary or fictional, but is very real in the rotating reference frame. The Coriolis force tends to make things on the surface of the object to spiral a certain direction. As the earth rotates, this motion causes everything on the surface to experience the Coriolis force, including the water in your sink. But, the Coriolis force is so weak that it doesn't really do anything until it acts on a lot of material. Your sink simply does not have enough water to be affected by the Coriolis force. On the other hand, hurricanes usually spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere because they have enough material to be affected by the Coriolis force, as detailed in the textbook ""An Introduction of Dynamic Meteorology"" by James R. Holtone. Tornadoes are too small to be affected by the Coriolis force and spin in any direction. The spinning direction of drain water is random, determined mostly by how the water is bumped, sloshed, or distributed when it starts to drain.";;driven,failed,silly,lead,clothes
Cambridge;O;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2004;Aug Sep;"What keeps the continents floating on a sea of molten rock?
";"The continents do not float on a sea of molten rock. The continental and oceanic crusts sit on a thick layer of solid rock known as the mantle. While there is a layer of liquid rock in the earth known as the outer core, this layer is about 3000 km below earth's surface and is separated from the surface by the thick solid mantle. The tectonic plates do not slowly drift over time because they are floating on a layer of liquid rock. They drift because they are sitting on a layer of solid rock (the upper mantle or ""asthenosphere"") that is weak and ductile enough that it can flow very slowly under heat convection, somewhat like a liquid.";If there is not a giant sea of magma under the continents, where does lava come from? The molten lava that spews out of volcanoes is created locally right under the volcano rather than being released from a global sea of magma. Magma is created when pressure changes melt the rock. For instance, as two tectonic plates collide, one plate may get forced under the other plate. As it does so, the plate that is forced down (subducted) releases water into the upper mantle which lowers the pressure enough to melt the rock. Localized regions of magma form in the mantle near subduction zones. The mantle can then rise and create volcanoes. The point is that magma is created in small pockets (small relative to the size of the earth) as part of the tectonic plate movement, and does not exist as a global sea of magma just under the crust. The confusion about the state of the upper mantle perhaps arises from the way diagrams are presented. For instance, the image above shows the mantle in a glowing orange color. This coloring can be confused to mean that this layer is hot liquid rock, like lava. In reality, the mantle is solid, and the coloring is just meant to indicate that the rock is hot and flowing slowly under heat convention.;"The textbook Physical Geography by Robert Gabler, James Peterson, L. Trapasso, and Dorothy Sack states, ""Extending down from the base of the lithosphere about 600 kilometers (375 mi) farther into the mantle is the asthenosphere (from Greek: asthenias, without strength), a thick layer of plastic mantle material. The material in the asthenosphere can flow both vertically and horizontally, dragging segments of the overlying, rigid lithosphere along with it.""";congress,large,try,citizen,giving

";"Raindrops are not tear shaped when falling through the air. They are approximately round. As captured by James E. McDonald in a Journal of Meteorology article titled ""The Shape and Aerodynamics of Large Raindrops"", drops can even take on hamburger shapes when they get big enough. You might think that the resistance of the air flowing passed the falling drop would smear it backwards to form a tail. But the air resistance instead just flattens the front of the drop. The smaller the rain drop, the smaller the effect of air resistance and the more spherical the raindrop becomes.";"Perhaps this misconception arises from the fact that raindrops streaking down a window are tear shaped for the same reason tears streaking down your face are tear shaped: friction. The window, or your skin, has enough friction to drag some of the water back into a tail. The air does not. Tailed drops streaking down a transparent window seem to be falling in air, but are not.

";The Sahara is not the largest desert in the world. Antarctica is the largest desert in the world. Deserts are not defined by hot temperatures and sand dunes. Rather, deserts are defined by a very low amount of rain and snow. These low amounts of precipitation lead to very little liquid water on the ground. As a result, deserts are identified by significantly low amounts of animal and plant life.;"While Antarctica does have a lot of water in the form of ice, its cold temperatures keeps the ice from turning into liquid water even in the summer. The cold temperatures also freeze the water vapor out of the air. The end result is that Antarctica is not only a desert, it is the driest continent in the world. Because the characterizing feature of a desert is dryness and not temperature, there are cold deserts, warm deserts, and hot deserts. This dryness can be caused by a rain shadow effect where mountains block moisture-carrying clouds from reaching the desert region. The dryness of deserts can also be caused by the region simply being too far away from any source of moisture. Lastly, the low moisture characterizing desert terrain can be caused by cold temperatures locking moisture into solid form. The dangers that people associate most commonly with hot deserts; such as sunburn, cracked lips, dehydration, and barren landscapes; are also dangers faced by visitors to Antarctica.";;knife,nature,especially,universe,failed
Cambridge;AS;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2002;Aug Sep;"What makes the soil in tropical rainforests so rich?
";"Actually, the soil in tropical rainforests is very poor. You would think with all that vegetation, warmth, and moisture that the soil must be very rich. But the truth is otherwise, as people who live in these regions are well aware. According to the textbook ""Tropical Rainforests: Latin American Nature and Society in Transition"" edited by Susan E. Place, there are several reasons for the poor soil of tropical rainforests:";"The soil is highly acidic. The roots of plants rely on an acidity difference between the roots and the soil in order to absorb nutrients. When the soil is acidic, there is little difference, and therefore little absorption of nutrients from the soil.
The type of clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients and stop them from washing away. Even if humans artificially add nutrients to the soil, the nutrients mostly wash away and are not absorbed by the plants.
The high temperature and moisture of tropical rainforests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose more quickly than in other climates, thus releasing and losing its nutrients rapidly.
The high volume of rain in tropical rainforests washes nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in other climates.
When farmers cut down tropical rainforests and use its soil to try to grow crops, they find little success because of the poor nature of the soil. The textbook quotes soil authority Robert Pendleton as saying,

""In higher latitudes, and particularly in the United States, a widespread opinion prevails that such humid regions as the enormous Amazon basin, now occupied by luxuriant and apparently limitless tropical high forests, must certainly have rich soils, and hence, great potentialities for the production of food, fiber, and other agricultural crops...on the whole, the soils of the humid equatorial regions have distressingly limited possibilities for plant production... This pessimistic attitude is no longer a result of mere opinion, for in a number of widely scattered regions in the humid low latitudes agricultural scientists have been and still are seriously at work.""";If the soil is so poor in tropical rain forests, how does such a dense array of shrubs and trees grow there? The answer lies above the soil. On the ground of the rain forest, there is a thick layer of quickly decaying plants and animals. Nutrients are washed by the heavy rains almost directly from the rotting surface material into the the trees without entering the soil much.;trap,clothes,again,region,up
Cambridge;A;7010 - Computer Studies;2011;May Jun;What would happen if you fell into a hole that went through the center of the earth?;For the sake of the argument, let's assume you could dig a wide, perfectly straight hole directly down to the center of earth and out to the other side of earth. Further suppose the hole has a strong enough wall to keep it from collapsing or melting. What would happen if you fell into this hole?;"After falling about 0.15 kilometers (0.002% of the way to earth's center), you encounter about 20 atmospheres of air pressure and die from hyperoxia. The farther your corpse falls, the more it becomes crushed by the intense air pressure. Note that this pressure is from the air itself above you pressing down and not from the rocks. As you can see, you do not make it very far at all in your journey through the earth before dying. Let's assume you are able to put on some kind of futuristic pressure suit that can protect you from any amount of pressure. What would happen to you if you fell in the hole with this pressure suit on?

After falling about 1.1 kilometers (0.02% of the way to earth's center), you encounter a temperature of about 320 Kelvin and die of heat stroke. After falling a total distance of about 2.7 kilometers (0.04% of the way to earth's center), your corpse encounters a temperature of about 400 Kelvin and your bodily fluids begin to boil away. Upon falling to about 200 kilometers deep (3% of the way to earth's center), your dried up bones and remnants of flesh encounter a temperature of about 1200 Kelvin and are completely incinerated into dust. Your dust remains then fall the rest of the 6200 kilometers (97% of the way) to the earth's center. As should be obvious, going deep into the earth is generally a bad idea. Even with a pressure suit, you don't get very far before being incinerated from the heat. Note that you don't have to be touching the tunnel walls to feel this heat. The air itself in the tunnel is at these temperatures.

Let's assume you put on some kind of futuristic suit that protects you from all pressure effects, all heat effects, all toxic gas effects, and all radiation effects. Then what happens when you jump in the hole? You accelerate as you fall, picking up speed because of earth's gravity. After about ten seconds, having traveled 0.5 kilometers down (0.008% of the way to earth's center), you reach a maximum speed of about 200 kilometers per hour (120 mph). The air resistance at this speed is high enough to prevent you from accelerating more. The farther you fall, the weaker the gravity becomes because more and more of the earth's mass is above you canceling the gravity from the other side of the earth. Also, as you fall, the air pressure goes up so that the air exerts more force against your motion. With gravity getting weaker, and air resistance getting stronger, your speed steadily drops.

After about a week or so of falling (with a maximum speed of 200 km/h, it takes you a while to travel the 6400 km to the center), you finally reach the exact center of the earth. The strength of gravity at the center of earth is zero because there are equal amounts of matter in all directions, all exerting an equal gravitational pull. Also, the air in the hole is so dense at this point that it is like traveling through soup. The small amount of momentum you have at this point will cause you to overshoot the center of the earth and keep on moving through the hole. But once you are past the center of the earth, ""down"" is now in the other direction, so that you slow down and reverse direction before getting much beyond the center. You continually fall back to the center of earth, overshoot it under your own momentum, and then fall back from the other direction. This motion is much like a yo-yo or a child on a playground swing who is continually overshooting the lowest point. With such thick air, you eventually lose momentum and stop your yo-yo motion about the center of the earth. You end up stuck floating at the center of the earth.";"What if the tunnel was completely evacuated of all its air? Without air, there would be no air resistance. You would therefore accelerate to incredible speeds as you fall, reaching a maximum speed on the order of tens of thousands of kilometers per hour . You reach earth's center in a matter of minutes or hours instead of weeks. With such immense speed, you completely overshoot earth's center. As you travel through the far end of the hole, gravity is now in the opposite direction and slows you down. You are slowed down to zero speed just as you emerge from the hole on the other side of the world. This makes sense from an energy conservation viewpoint: you started at rest at one side of the world, so you must end up at rest on the other side of the world if no energy is lost to air resistance.

";Contrary to popular belief, the safest place to go when a tornado hits is not under a highway overpass. This location has little to protect you from debris being thrown around by the tornado. Additionally, overpasses can collapse. Most of the damage that a tornado causes is due to its high winds knocking down structures and hurling debris like bullets. When rocks, metal signs, roof shingles, or wall studs get picked up and thrown at high velocity by the wind, they act like cannonballs;"The main damage from a tornado is not due to an air pressure difference that makes sealed houses explode. For this reason, opening windows before a tornado to relieve air pressure will not lessen the damage. With these concepts in mind, the safest place to go in a tornado strike is not outside, in your car, or under a highway. Tornadoes have been known to pick up cars, trucks, and even buses. The safest place to seek shelter from a tornado is deep inside a strong building where you will be protected from flying debris and collapsing outer walls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends the following course of action in a tornado warning: If you are in a mobile home or outside, get to a solid building as soon as possible. Once in the building, ""Go to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level...go to a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible."" Furthermore, FEMA recommends that if you can't get to a building in time, seek out a low spot. ""If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway, leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands. Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location."" Also be aware that a tornado can be touching the ground and causing damage even if it does not appear to visibly reach the ground. The invisible wind of the tornado is what causes the damage and not the funnel cloud trapped in the tornado.";;before,exist,laid,universe,dawn

Cambridge;A;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2007;Oct Nov;"Why did so many people believe the world is flat when it is obviously a sphere?
";The earth is not a sphere. The earth is an oblate spheroid with a diameter at the equator that is 43 km larger than at the poles, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.;This bulging at the equator is caused by the spinning motion of the earth, much like how spinning pizza dough in the air causes it to flatten due to centrifugal force. The centrifugal force is very real in the non-inertial frame, and is not imaginary or fictional, but is simply non-fundamental in that it arises from the spinning motion of the frame itself. Furthermore, because of mountains, oceans, hills, canyons, etc., the earth is not really an oblate spheroid. But these deviations from a perfectly smooth oblate spheroid shape are only 0.001% of the earth's radius, so the earth has the shape to a very good approximation.;"Also, virtually nobody has ever believed the earth is flat. This is a myth according to historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, as explained in his book ""Inventing the Flat Earth"". As far back as the ancient Greeks, man has known the earth is round. Around 240 BC, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference to a fairly accurate value without ever leaving Egypt using shadows and geometry. Christopher Columbus did not sail on his famous voyage in order to prove the earth was round. Rather, he sailed to try to find a quicker route to the Indes going West instead of East, knowing that a round earth means you can go either way. The myth that people once believed the earth was flat was created by authors such as Draper and Dickson in order to exaggerate the conflict between religion and science.";operation,plus,driven,adventure,trap

";"Car tires do not protect you from lightning strikes. Although the rubber in a tire acts as an insulator at low voltages, the voltage in a lighting bolt is far too high to be stopped by tires or air. No matter how thick your tires are, they don't stop lightning according to physicist Martin Uman in his book ""All About Lightning"". Dr. Uman states that inside a car can be a safe place to wait out a lighting storm, but it's not because any materials are blocking the lightning.";Rather, if the car is struck by lightning, its metal frame redirects the electrical current around the sides of the car and into the ground without touching the interior contents. The ability of a hollow conducting object to protect its interior from electrical fields and currents is one of the fundamental principles of electromagnetics. Such an object is called a Faraday cage. For this reason, riding around in a convertible, on a motorbike or on a bicycle during a lightning storm is a bad idea, no matter what kind of tires it has. If you are in a fully-enclosed metal vehicle, you should be protected from the lighting by the Faraday-cage effect. However, you should still park the vehicle and wait out the storm since a lightning strike can blow out your tires or blow out your vehicle's electronic control circuits, potentially causing you to crash if you are driving. If you are riding in a convertible or roofless vehicle, on a motorbike, or on a bicycle and are caught in a lightning storm, you should quickly seek out the nearest shelter. If a building, tunnel, or other large sheltering structure is not readily available, seek out a low point in the terrain away from water, away from isolated trees, and away from other tall structures (e.g. windmills, power-line towers).;;regular,pay,laid,happily,were
Edexcel;A;5054 - Physics;2020;May Jun;Why does a magnetic compass point to the Geographic North Pole?;A magnetic compass does not point to the geographic north pole. A magnetic compass points to the earth's magnetic poles, which are not the same as earth's geographic poles. Furthermore, the magnetic pole near earth's geographic north pole is actually the south magnetic pole.;"When it comes to magnets, opposites attract. This fact means that the north end of a magnet in a compass is attracted to the south magnetic pole, which lies close to the geographic north pole. Magnetic field lines outside of a permanent magnet always run from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. Therefore, the magnetic field lines of the earth run from the southern geographic hemisphere towards the northern geographic hemisphere.

The geographic north and south poles indicate the points where the earth's rotation axis intercepts earth's surface. Consider holding a tennis ball between your thumb and forefinger and pushing on the side to make it spin. The points where your thumb and finger make contact are the geographic north and south poles of the tennis ball's spin. A person standing on the equator is moving the fastest due to earth's rotation, while a person standing on a geographic pole does not move at all from earth's rotation. Earth's magnetic poles designate the central location of the region where the magnetic fields lines start and finish. Earth's geographic and magnetic poles are not exactly aligned because they arise from different mechanisms. Earth's magnetic field is caused by circulating currents of liquid iron in the outer core.";Furthermore, earth's magnetic poles are constantly changing location relative to earth's geographic poles. Currently, the magnetic south pole lies about ten degrees distant from the geographic north pole, and sits in the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska. The north end on a compass therefore currently points roughly towards Alaska and not exactly towards geographic north.;applied,nearer,say,of,bring
Edexcel;A;5054 - Physics;2011;Jan Feb;Why does the coldest time of the year align with the darkest time of the year?;In general, the coldest time of the year does not align with the darkest time of the year. The basic reason for this discrepancy is the fact that objects take time to cool down and heat up.;"The earth rotates daily about its rotational axis, which is an imaginary line connecting the North and South geographic poles. In addition, the earth orbits once a year in a nearly circular path around the sun. The axis of earth's rotational motion is tilted 23.4Â° away from the axis of its orbital motion around the sun. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, earth's rotational axis always points roughly to the same region in the starry sky (generally towards Polaris). This means that as the earth orbits the sun, at one point in the year, the North Pole is tilted 23.4Â° directly towards the sun (the northern summer solstice); at another point in the year, the North Pole is tilted 23.4Â° directly away from the sun (the northern winter solstice); and at two other points in the year, the North Pole is titled 23.4Â° exactly to the side with respect to the sun (spring equinox and autumn equinox).

orbit of the earth and its tilt creating the seasons
The day of the year when the Northern Hemisphere receives the least average sunlight is Dec. 21, which is about a month before the average coldest day of the year. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
The more a spot on earth's surface is tilted away from the sun, the less time that spot spends each day in daylight. The day that the North Pole tilts the most away from the sun is therefore the shortest day of the year (plus or minus a day because of the way we define time zones), and the day that the North Pole tilts the most towards the sun is the longest day of the year (plus or minus a day). The northern winter solstice occurs every year some time between Dec. 20 and Dec. 22. The exact day changes because of the way we as humans have designed our calendar and time zones and not because the actual timing of the solstice physically changes every year. As soon as Dec. 20-22 has come and gone on the Northern Hemisphere, the days begin getting longer and brighter.

Since sunlight is the principal agent that warms the earth, and since the Northern Hemisphere starts getting more light every day after Dec. 20-22, you may be led to believe that Dec. 20-22 is not only the darkest time of the year, but also the coldest time of the year. But this assumption is false. In the Northern Hemisphere, the coldest time of year is generally the middle of January. The exact day that is the coldest varies from town to town, and from year to year because the weather is a very complex phenomenon shaped by many factors. But averaged over many years and over many locations, the coldest time of year is the middle of January. The coldest time of year is therefore typically 3 to 4 weeks after the darkest time of year. Why?";While it is true that the earth is mostly warmed by sunlight, it takes time for the earth to cool down and heat back up after the sunlight has reached the minimum in its cycle. Summer heat is stored in the ground, plants, and water on earth's surface. When the low-light conditions of December come, the earth is losing a lot of heat but has not lost all of it compared to the coldest day. Even though the end of December and beginning of January has more light warming the earth than on winter solstice, there is not enough heat being inputted by the light to offset the massive amounts of heat still being lost by the earth because of its previously high temperatures. The average coldest day of the year in middle January is only reached when the heat inputted by the increasing levels of sunlight overcomes the amount of heat lost by the earth each day. The situation is a bit like putting hot soup that is at 200Â° F into an oven that is at 100Â° F, but is steadily increasing to 300Â° F. The soup will at first cool down even though more and more heat is being pumped into the soup every minute. Eventually, the oven's temperature surpasses the temperature of the cooling soup, and the soup begins heating up again.;refer,add,done,official,directly
Edexcel;O;2210 - Computer Science;2016;Oct Nov;Why doesn't the outside world appear blue even though so much light comes from the blue sky?;Actually, a lot of the outside world on a sunny day is tinted blue because of the blue sky. The blue tinting of the outside world is quite striking if you know how to look for it.;"Sunlight that has just left the sun contains a relatively equal mix of all spectral colors and is therefore white. When the sunlight passes through the air in earth's atmosphere, some of the light is scattered sideways by the air molecules. The air molecules scatter a little bit of all colors out of the forward-traveling beam of sunlight, but blue and violet colors are scattered the most, giving the sky a whitish-blue appearance. Since more blue and violet light have been removed from the forward traveling beam than other colors, the direct sunlight that reaches earth's surface is slightly tinted orange-red compared to the sunlight given off at the sun's surface. But this orange-red tint is so small (because the total amount of light scattered out by the atmosphere is small compared to the sunlight that continues on in the forward direction) that direct sunlight that reaches earth's surface is still white.

The white direct sunlight is much brighter than the blue skylight, and this is the main reason that the entire outside world is not completely blue. White light contains all colors, so a scene illuminated by white light will show all the innate colors of the objects in the scene. When illuminated by white light such as sunlight, we are able to see the grass as green, the flowers as red and wood as brown. The world shows its usual mix of colors when illuminated by white light.

This diagram illustrates how our eyes are good at seeing relative color but not absolute color. The squares of color containing the black dots are both exactly the same color, but our eyes can't see this because our perception is overloaded with local relative color difference information. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.";"White sunlight is so bright compared to blue skylight that when an object is in direct sunlight, it just looks like its innate color. But, when an object is in shadow so that direct sunlight cannot reach it (and there are not too many clouds that block the skylight), the object is now being illuminated only by blue skylight. Shadows on a clear day are therefore blue tinted. The more shadows there are, the more the world around you is tinted blue. When the sun is low in the sky and behind the trees, the entire landscape can end up being shadowed from direct sunlight and therefore be blue tinted. We often don't notice the blueness of the outside world because our human eyes are better at seeing relative color than absolute color. This means that our eyes are better at picking out color differences than at picking out an overall color on an absolute scale, as shown in the image above. But the blue tint of the outside world becomes obvious if you look into an area of deep shadow on a bright, clear day. The blue tint of shadows can make for dazzling scenery worthy of being painted or photographed.

Edexcel;O;7707 - Accounting;2013;Aug Sep;"Why don't the oceans freeze?
";If the temperature is cold enough, ocean water does freeze. The polar ice cap at earth's North Pole is a giant slab of frozen ocean water. At earth's South Pole, the land mass constituting Antarctica complicates the situation, so most of the ice there is compacted snow. Over cold regions such as Antarctica, Greenland, and Canada, the fresh water in the air freezes to snow and falls onto the land without a melting season to get rid of it.;"Over time, this snow builds up and compacts into an ice mass known as a glacier. Gravity slowly pulls the glacier downhill until it reaches out onto the ocean, forming an ice shelf. The ocean-bound edge of the ice shelf slowly crumbles into icebergs which float off on their own path. For this reason, glaciers, ice shelves, and icebergs are all thick sheets of frozen fresh water and not frozen ocean water. In contrast, when ocean water freezes, it forms a thin flat layer known as sea ice or pack ice. Sea ice has long been the enemy of ships seeking an open route through cold waters, but modern ice breaker ships have no problem breaking a path through the fields of frozen ocean.

Despite the fact that the oceans do freeze when the temperature is cold enough, ocean water does indeed stay liquid under much colder weather than one would first expect. For instance, go to the beach on a winter day and you may be surprised to find that the ocean is still liquid despite the snow and ice on the ground being frozen. There are four main factors that keep the ocean in a liquid state much more than may be expected, as described in the textbook Essentials of Oceanography by Tom Garrison.

1. Salt
The high concentration of salt in ocean water lowers its freezing point from 32Â° F (0Â° C) to 28Â° F (-2Â° C). As a result, the ambient temperature must reach a lower point in order to freeze the ocean than to freeze freshwater lakes. This freezing-point depression effect is the same reason we throw salt on icy sidewalks in the winter. The salt lowers the freezing point of the ice below the ambient temperature and it melts. Note that if the ambient temperature is lower than 28Â° F (-2Â° C), the ocean water would be ice if this were the only effect involved. Such is not the case, so there must be other effects involved.

2. Ocean currents
The gravitational pull of the moon, earth's spinning motion, and thermal convection combine to create large-scale flows of ocean water known as ocean currents. This constant motion of the ocean water helps keep the water molecules from freezing into the somewhat stationary state of ice crystals. More significantly, the ocean currents continuously pump warm water from the equatorial regions to the colder ocean regions.

3. High volume
The larger the volume of water, the more heat has to be removed in order to freeze it. A teaspoon of water placed in the freezer will become completely solid long before a gallon jug of water. More accurately, it is the surface-area to volume ratio for a given external temperature that determines the rate of heat loss and therefore the speed of freezing. Because the heat must be lost through its surface, a small shallow puddle with a large surface will freeze quicker than a deep lake. The immense volume and depth of the oceans keeps them from freezing too quickly, thereby allowing the heating mechanisms to have a larger effect.

4. Earth's internal heating
As miners are well aware, the earth gets hotter and not colder as you dig straight down, despite the fact that you are getting farther away from the warm sunlight. The reason for this is that the earth has its own internal heat source which is driven primarily by the nuclear decay of elements inside earth's mantle. The earth's internal heat is most evident when lava flows and hot springs poke through the surface. Because earth's insulating crust is much thinner under the oceans than under the continents, most of the earth's internal heat escapes into the oceans. Although the temperature of the air at an ocean's surface may be freezing, the temperature of the water deep in the ocean is significantly warmer due to internal heating.";This combination of salt, ocean currents, high volume, and internal heating keeps most of the ocean in liquid form even during cold winters.;sky,region,pay,bend,west
Edexcel;A;5054 - Physics;2013;Oct Nov;"Why is the sky blue?
";"If you look in any popular science book on this topic, it will tell you that the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere. While Rayleigh scattering is a very important part of the answer, it is not the only part. If the only effect at work were Rayleigh scattering, then the sky would be violet, not blue. In fact, there are four factors involved; all required to give the final answer of blue:";"Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere
The incident sunlight spectrum is a thermal distribution
Bulk attenuation by the atmosphere
The human eyes and brain mix and perceive colors non-linearly
Rayleigh scattering is what happens when light bounces off an object that is much smaller than its wavelength. Physical derivations show that for Rayleigh scattering, the higher frequency colors such as blue and violet are scattered much more strongly than low frequency colors such as red and orange. Mathematically, the intensity of scattered light is proportional to f 4, where f is the frequency of the light. This means that a color that is twice the frequency of another color will be 16 times brighter than that other color after scattering if they both were equally bright to start out with. In the atmosphere, the objects doing the scattering are mostly nitrogen molecules (N2) and oxygen molecules (O2). These molecules are much smaller than visible light (oxygen molecules are about 0.1 nanometers wide and visible light has a wavelength of about 500 nanometers), so the scattering in the atmosphere is Rayleigh scattering. But if this were the end of the story, the sky would be violet and not blue because violet is the highest-frequency visible color. Let us look at the other effects.

sky spectrum due to Rayleigh scattering alone
The color spectrum of the sky if only Rayleigh scattering were involved. The sky would look violet. It's a good thing there is more going on than Rayleigh scattering, otherwise we would be fried by all that ultraviolet radiation. The y axis is the brightness of a certain color. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
Most people think that the sunlight traveling through space before it hits our atmosphere is a perfectly white color. Perfect white is an equal mix of all colors. In reality, the sunlight hitting the atmosphere does not have an equal distribution of colors, but has a thermal (black-body) distribution. The sun is a big ball of incandescent gas very similar to a candle flame. The light that our sun sends out into to space is created by its heat, and therefore it has a thermal distribution of colors. The exact nature of a thermal distribution depends on the temperature of the glowing object (i.e. red-hot toaster elements vs. white-hot coals). The sun's surface temperature is at about 5800 Kelvin, which gives a thermal distribution that peaks in the infrared (in frequency space). The sunlight that hits the atmosphere is therefore not an equal mix of all colors, but is a mix of all colors with red-orange dominating, and with more blue than violet (at least in frequency space). This helps explain why the sky is blue and not violet. But it turns out to still not be enough.

sky spectrum due to Rayleigh scattering and thermal sunlight

Bulk attenuation means that as sunlight travels through the thick atmosphere, it becomes progressively weaker because it is being partially scattered all along the way. The rate at which it becomes weaker is faster for higher-frequency colors. In other words, because blue and violet scatter the strongest, they are also removed the quickest from the forward traveling beam as it travels down through atmosphere. Bulk attenuation is what makes sunsets red and orange. At sunset, the sunlight is approaching an observer at a low angle, so it has to travel through much more atmosphere. It travels through so much air in fact, that by the time the light reaches the layer of air closest to the grounded observer, all of the green, blue and violet colors have long since been scattered out by higher layers of atmosphere, leaving just red and orange. While it is still true that the air in the layer of sky closest to the observer scatters blue and violet light the strongest, there is no blue or violet light left in the light beam to scatter at sunset because of bulk attenuation. Even during the day when the sun is high in the sky, bulk attenuation has an effect. The sunlight in the forward beam near the bottom of the atmosphere has less violet than blue as compared to the beam when it was in the top of the atmosphere because the violet color scatters more quickly our of the forward beam. While this helps explain why the sky is blue and not violet, it is not enough.

At sunset, the bulk attenuation effect shifts this entire curve to red colors. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.";"Finally, human eyes perceive color in a non-linear fashion. For instance, if a blue spot on the wall sits next to a violet spot on the wall, and a laboratory tool measures them both to be equal brightness, our eyes will perceive the blue spot to be brighter. In a loose sense, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light. But the situation is more complex than this statement makes it seem. Our eyes have three color receptors: red, green, and blue, but these receptors overlap quite a bit. Our brains then mix the three signals non-linearly to give us the experience of color. In a simplified view, equal parts of red, green, and blue are perceived as white, whereas a little red plus a little green plus a lot of blue-violet is perceived as whitish-blue. Our brains mix together the spectrum shown above to give us the sky blue shown below. All of the effects mentioned above are needed to explain why humans see the sky as blue.

Cambridge;A;5054 - Physics;2019;Oct Nov;"Why is the sky not blue as seen from space?
";The daytime sky is indeed blue as seen from space. Look closely at any color-accurate photograph of earth taken from space and the blue tint of everything on the day side is unmistakable. This blue tint is the sky. The daytime sky as viewed from space is not a solid, uniform blob of blue for two reasons: (1) there are white clouds in the sky which can be seen just as well from space as from earth's surface, and (2) the sky is not opaque.;"Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen molecules and oxygen molecules bouncing around as a gas. Air is close to perfectly transparent. It's a good thing, because the transparency of air is what allows you to see your computer screen and breath at the same time. However, air is not perfectly transparent. A very small amount of the light that passes through air is scattered in all directions instead of being allowed to continue traveling on in the forward direction. This scattering is called Rayleigh scattering. Blue and violet colors are scattered the strongest by air. As a result, when white light travels through air, it gives a slight bluish-white tint to the air. (Air is actually tinted violet-bluish-white. However, since humans can't see the color violet very well, we see air as bluish white.) It's true that when look at your friend across the room, you don't see her as tinted blue. But this is because there is so little air between you and your friend that the amount of light scattered by the air is far below what your eyes can detect. However, if enough air is present, the blue tint of air indeed becomes noticeable to humans. This is what the daytime sky is: a large enough mass of air that its blue tint becomes noticeable to humans.

Despite the atmosphere containing so much air, it does not contain enough air to scatter 100% of the light and therefore act as opaque. We thus see the sky as a whitish-blue semi-transparent layer. When standing on the surface of the earth and looking up at the daytime sky, you may be tempted to think that the sky is opaque. However, the daytime sky often looks like a uniform, featureless stretch of blue only because there are so few bright objects beyond the sky. The stars are so dim that their light is overpowered during the day by the sunlight scattered by the sky. The semi-transparent nature of the daytime sky is made obvious by the fact that you can see the moon during the day from the surface of the earth. And as expected, the moon as seen from the surface of the earth during the day is tinted blue. You can see the moon just fine through the daytime sky, indicting that it is semi-transparent. The atmosphere between you and the moon just causes the moon to gain a blue tint during the day. For the exact same reason, an astronaut in space that is looking down at earth's surface can see mountains and deserts just fine, but he sees them as tinted blue.";"This all makes sense, but there still seems to be photos of earth taken from space that are not tinted blue. How can we account for these photos? There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, many photos that are referred to as ""space photos"" or ""satellite imagery"" are actually taken from airplanes that are very low in the atmosphere and therefore don't pick up very much of the blue tint. For instance, most of the images in Google Earth were taken from airplanes (however, Google Earth artificially tints some images blue at certain viewing angles and zoom levels in order to make them look more realistic). Additionally, many photos of earth that are genuinely taken from space have their colors altered in order to intentionally remove the blue tint. As long as a photograph has accurate colors and is taken from space, the daytime Earth will be everywhere tinted blue because of the atmosphere.";try,means,not,especially,chance
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2017;Aug Sep;"Why is the sun cold in the winter?
";The sun does not get cold in the winter. The sun is a giant ball of fire driven by nuclear reactions. The surface of the sun stays at an incredibly hot temperature of about 5800 Kelvin all year long. The high temperature of the sun causes it to constantly emit prodigious amounts of thermal radiation in all directions, mostly in the form of infrared waves, visible light, and ultraviolet waves. This radiation spreads throughout our solar system and warms everything it hits.;"Regions of earth are colder in the winter because the tilt of the earth causes the sunlight to be spread over a larger area and therefore be weaker per unit area in these regions. Some people think the earth gets colder in the winter because the earth is farther away from the sun, but this idea is wrong. In fact, the earth is farthest from the sun in the northern hemisphere's summer, and not winter. But distance to the sun does not have much effect on the amount of sunlight the earth receives because the distance to the sun does not really change that much. The earth is about 150,000,000 kilometers away from the sun. Over the course of a year, the distance from the earth to the sun changes by at most 5 million kilometers. To put this in perspective, the orbit of the earth around the sun throughout the year is plotted below to scale. You can't tell, but at this scale the earth is 302 pixels from the sun when at the leftmost point in its orbit and 298 pixels from the sun when at the rightmost point.

orbit of earth around sun
The orbit of the earth around the sun, with all sizes and locations to scale. The white dot near the center is the sun, and the blue line is the path of the earth through-out the year. The earth itself is not visible because at this scale it is only 0.02 pixels wide. The distance of the earth from the sun is more or less constant through-out the year. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
The axis of earth's rotation is tilted about 23 degrees with respect to its orbit around the sun. This mean's that in the north's summer time, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and in the winter time, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. When a region of land is tilted towards the sun in the summer, that means that the sun spends more time higher in the sky and the sunlight received by that spot of land is more direct. In contrast, when that spot on the earth is tilted away from the sun in the winter, the sun is in general lower in the sky, and it receives less direct sunlight. Less direct sunlight means that the sunlight is coming in at a low angle, so that it is smeared across a greater area when it hits the surface. Because it is smeared over a greater area, winter sunlight has less power per unit area, and therefore heats the earth less, leading to cold winters.";Interestingly, when the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, the southern hemisphere is tilted away. This means that when the north is having summer, the south is having winter and when the north is having winter, the south is having summer. The effect of sunlight angle on temperature can be most easily seen at the extremes. Near the south pole and the north pole, the sun is always very low in the sky, and the sunlight always comes in at a very low angle. As a result, the poles are generally very cold. In contrast, near the equator, the sun is always high in the sky around noon and the sunlight is very direct. As a result, the regions near the equator are generally very hot.;stand,using,acres,personal,planning
Cambridge;O;3204 - Bengali;2017;Oct Nov;"Are any pills perfectly safe?
";Nothing in this world is perfectly safe. Even drinking too much water can kill you. Newspapers contain several sad accounts of people dying of water overdose, many of them a result of drinking competitions, extreme child discipline, or fad diets. For instance, Jennete Killpack was sent to prison for killing her daughter by forcing her to drink large amounts of water as a punishment. In a separate case, Jennifer Strange died of water overdose while participating in a water drinking contest sponsored by a local radio station.;"Drinking high levels of water leads to a potentially lethal condition known as ""water intoxication"" or ""dilutional hyponatremia"". In this condition, the excess water dilutes the sodium in the body down to dangerously low concentrations, leading the brain to take up water and swell to the point of failure. In this way, even a substance that is considered one of the least toxic in the world can kill you. The same concept applies to everything we eat, drink, breath, and touch. Even the oxygen we breath, which is essential to life, can cause intoxication and death when breathed at high pressure.

My point is not to scare you into being afraid of everything around you. My point is to show that requiring a pill to be perfectly safe before ingesting it is pointless, since nothing is perfectly safe. A better approach is to choose the pill, food, or drink that is the safest choice. Drinking too much water may kill you, but drinking no water at all will also kill you. The safest alternative is to drink a moderate amount of water. Although ""perfectly safe"" does not exist, some options are typically ""relatively safe"" compared to the other options. The best approach is to choose the course of action which maximizes the long-term benefits while minimizing the long-term risks. For example, a pregnant woman with uncontrollable vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum, which is different and more severe than morning sickness) is faced with the choice of taking antiemetic medication such as promethazine. While taking antiemetic medication carries certain risks, not taking the medicine carries an even greater and very real risk of dying of dehydration from all of the vomiting (the author Charlotte Bronte is believed to have died of dehydration caused by hyperemesis gravidarum). In this case, the course of action with the least risk and the most benefit is typically taking the antiemetics. In contrast, a pregnant woman that only has standard morning sickness is not at risk of dying from dehydration. For such women, taking the antiemetics becomes the riskiest course of action and gives little long-term benefit. For this reason, doctors do not usually prescribe antiemetics to women with standard morning sickness.

As should be obvious at this point, you can't label some substances as always safe, and other substances as always dangerous. The situation is more complicated than that. In general, there are several factors that determine the risk that a substance can harm a person:

1. The toxicity of the substance
This is a measure of how much damage a standard amount of substance can cause. Water has a very low toxicity, caffeine has medium toxicity, and arsenic has high toxicity. This quality is innate to the chemical properties of the substance. Because of their high risk even when in small amounts, high-toxicity substances are typically regulated, handled, and administered by trained professionals.

2. The dose of the substance
This is a measure of the total amount of the substance that the person ingests or is exposed to. The safety of a substance is highly dependent on the dose. Drinking a cup of pure household bleach will do significant damage, but adding a teaspoon of bleach to 5 gallons of water can help make the water safer to drink. High doses of morphine can cause abnormal mind states and suppressed breathing, but the small amount of morphine found naturally in poppy seeds will have very little effect. A few bites of licorice candy are harmless, but eating several bags of licorice can give you high enough blood pressure to land you in the hospital. For substances that the body does not require in order to function normally, the safest dose is typically the lowest dose possible that can be practically achieved. A chemical can't hurt you if you are never exposed to it in significant quantities. For substances that the body needs, the situation is more complicated. Too little of the substance and your body will be malnourished or untreated. Too much of the substance and the toxic effects become significant. Therefore, for substances such as oxygen, water, food, vitamins, dietary elements, and medications necessary to treat disease, there is an ideal dose somewhere in the middle between zero and fatally toxic. How can you know what the ideal dosage is? For simple nutrients, our bodies have built-in feedback mechanisms. If you are drinking too little water, you feel thirsty. If you are drinking too much water, you feel nauseated. As long as you listen to your body (and have no underlying disease), there is little chance of you dying from dehydration or water intoxication. For medications, the situation is more complex since the body does not always have natural mechanisms to tell you that you are getting too much or too little of the medication. For this reason, it takes a trained doctor relying on a library of knowledge and on your unique state in order to determine the ideal dosage. The ""ideal dosage"" is whatever provides the greatest benefit relative to the risk, keeping in mind that not treating or under-treating a disease carries its own risks.

3. The person's unique sensitivity to the substance and their health situation
Everybody is different, and therefore responds differently to a certain dose of a certain substance. Eating moderate amounts of wheat may be perfectly healthy and harmless to most people, but to a person with Celiac's disease, even eating a single wheat cracker can cause damage and discomfort. Similarly, a person taking a typical medicinal dose of morphine for the first time will not have a tolerance to the drug and therefore will respond much more strongly than a chronic morphine user taking the same dose. As another example, a person with high blood pressure is more at risk when eating large amounts of salt than the typical person. Whatever the substance may be, the safety of a certain dose depends on the individual's sensitivity. Furthermore, certain drugs can alter how strongly you respond to other drugs. Therefore, the safety of a certain medication depends also on what other medications you are taking. The bottom line is that whether a certain dose of a specific substance is the safest option depends on your unique health situation. Doctors document your height, weight, allergies, sensitivities, current medications, known diseases, and lab test results in order to prescribe the right dose of the right drug for your individual needs.

Since the safety of a substance depends on its toxicity, the dose, and on your unique health situation, the safest approach is generally to take the medications and the dosages prescribed by a competent medical doctor who is familiar with your health. Taking more medication than prescribed can be dangerous since the drug can build up to toxic levels that your body cannot handle. Taking less medication than prescribed can also be dangerous as it can allow your disease to continue causing harm. If you do not trust your doctor, then go see another doctor and get a second opinion. But simply avoiding medications because you are worried that they are not perfectly safe can lead to serious health problems later on.

If you look at the documentation that comes with any prescribed medication, you will see a long list of possible side effects. Such long lists of side effects can be alarming. This list does not mean that you will personally experience all or any of those side effects. Furthermore, this list does not mean that avoiding the medication is your safest option. If you were to avoid every medication and substance that has a long list of alarming side effects, you would be forced to avoid everything, including water. As shown below, even water has a long list of potentially serious side effects. But since water never comes from the store with all these side effects listed on the side, we often deceive ourselves into thinking that prescription drugs are dangerous in a way that water and food are not. The bottom line is that you should base your decision on whether to take a medication on the advice of your doctor, and not on the existence of a long list of side effects for the medication.

Cambridge;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2013;Oct Nov;"Can a man's testosterone be boosted naturally?
";Yes, but probably not in the way you are thinking, and only if the man has a healthy testosterone hormone system to begin with. Testosterone is an important hormone that plays many roles. In adult males, testosterone promotes muscle growth, physical energy, assertive and competitive moods, sperm development, libido, and emotional bonding.;"A man with abnormally low testosterone therefore experiences low energy, muscle weakening, mood problems, infertility, low libido, and emotional distance. In contrast, a man with a significantly higher-than-normal testosterone level can enjoy high energy, strong muscles, constructive moods, increased libido, and emotional closeness. For these reasons, boosting testosterone is generally desirable. However, if the testosterone level is too high, it can cause liver damage, uncontrollable moods, and cardiovascular disease. The ideal level of testosterone is therefore in the high end of the normal range. Fortunately, a man can only get dangerously high levels of testosterone if he dopes or if he has a rare disease. Testosterone doping, which involves internally taking in testosterone from an external source without medical necessity, is inherently dangerous and unhealthy because it raises testosterone levels too high. Testosterone doping is therefore illegal. As long as you don't resort to illegal drugs, any action that boosts your testosterone will elevate your levels while keeping you safely in the normal range, thereby allowing you to enjoy the benefits without the risks.

Let's look at various agents and actions that do and do not boost testosterone. Keep in mind that all of the concepts below assume that the man has a healthy testosterone hormone system, which includes a properly functioning hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and testicles. If a man has a non-functioning testosterone hormone pathway, no amount of effort will naturally boost his testosterone levels. Such a man has to undergo hormone replacement therapy in order to have normal health. Also note that testosterone is a hormone with a long-term action. This means that a higher testosterone level will only lead to higher energy, bigger muscles, and better moods if the testosterone levels remain consistently elevated for several weeks to months. Agents that may lead to a temporary elevation of testosterone followed by a dip have no effect on long-term testosterone levels and therefore do not give the desired long-term benefits.

Testosterone precursor pills do not boost long-term testosterone levels.
Testosterone precursor pills are commonly sold on the shelves of pharmacies and convenience stores, and are marketed as performance enhancing drugs, but the truth is that they don't work. Chemicals such as DHEA, androstenedione, and androstenediol are indeed used by your body to manufacture testosterone. But just because you have elevated amounts of androstenedione in your blood does not mean that your body will automatically convert it all into elevated amounts of testosterone. In fact, your body will convert almost none of the surplus precursor. If testosterone precursor pills actually worked like testosterone doping does, they would be pulled off the shelves and be made just as illegal as testosterone doping. A review article in the Journal of Athletic Training written by Michael E. Powers presents numerous studies which found that taking testosterone precursor pills does not increase long-term testosterone levels. Researchers found that excessive testosterone precursors in the male body are converted to estrogen and not testosterone. Therefore, taking DHEA pills, androstenedione pills, or androstenediol pills leads to elevated estrogen in males, not testosterone. Powers states,

As mentioned previously, ergogenic claims are based on the theory that precursor ingestion will result in increased testosterone levels, which would then stimulate an increase in muscle protein synthesis. However, at this time, there is no scientific support for this theory, as both DHEA and A'dione ingestion have failed to increase protein synthesis in groups of young men. Furthermore, 8 weeks of A'dione supplementation (300 mg/d) and resistance training failed to increase muscle-fiber cross-sectional area when compared with placebo ingestion and training.

Sexual activity does not boost long-term testosterone levels.
While sexual activity, whether visual or physical, does indeed raise testosterone levels for a few hours after the activity, it has no effect on long-term testosterone levels. Therefore sexual activity does not lead to long-term testosterone-induced health benefits such as increased muscle mass or heightened physical energy. In fact, a study by Helena C. Kraemer and her collaborators found that, ""Mean testosterone levels were higher for sexually less active individuals.""

Exercise does boost long-term testosterone levels.
Consistent exercise has been found to indeed raise long-term testosterone levels. This makes sense since two major roles of testosterone are to build up muscle tissue and to provide higher energy levels, both of which are used when exercising. High-intensity workouts have traditionally been thought to increase testosterone more than moderate-intensity workouts. However, research has found that although this may be true for the hour after the workout, there is no long-term difference in testosterone levels between a man pursuing high-intensity exercise and a man pursuing moderate-intensity exercise, all else being equal. For example, a study by Truls Raastad and his collaborators published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology states, ""In conclusion, moderate- and high-intensity strength exercise did not differ with respect to prolonged (1-33 h) hormonal responses.""

Adequate sleep does boost long-term testosterone levels.
Just like many other hormones, the release of testosterone follows a daily pattern of highs and lows that is regulated to some extent by the sleep cycle. Therefore, ongoing inadequate sleep, interrupted sleep, and irregular sleep all interfere with the release cycle and lead to lower testosterone levels. While developing good sleep habits will not boost testosterone much beyond the average healthy value, it will keep it from dipping below this value. A research letter by Rachel Leproult and Eve Van Cauter, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, states, ""Daytime testosterone levels were decreased by 10% to 15% in this small convenience sample of young healthy men who underwent 1 week of sleep restriction to 5 hours per night...""

Losing weight and eating a healthy diet does boost long-term testosterone levels.
In addition to a host of other health benefits, losing excess body weight and eating a nutritious, balanced diet indeed increases long-term testosterone levels. Eating too much sugar has been found to reduce testosterone levels, as has obesity in general. A review article by Giovanni Corona and his collaborators, published in the European Journal of Endocrinology, presents their compilation of the results of 24 research studies. The review article concludes that, ""Overall, both a low-calorie diet and bariatric surgery are associated with a significant (P<0.0001) increase in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin-bound and -unbound testosterone levels (total testosterone (TT)), with bariatric surgery being more effective in comparison with the low-calorie diet...Androgen rise is greater in those patients who lose more weight...""

Reducing stress does boost long-term testosterone levels.
Ongoing psychological stress has been found to lower testosterone levels. Ongoing stress induces the body to release elevated amounts of the stress hormone cortisol, which signals to the body to make changes allowing it to better cope with the stress. One of these changes is the reduction of testosterone. The body makes this change so that energy and attention can be devoted to surviving the stress instead of building up body mass and enabling reproduction. Therefore, reducing the level of ongoing stress in a man's life can boost long-term testosterone levels. Note that over-exercising is a type of stress.";"Taking vitamin D supplements and zinc supplements can boost long-term testosterone levels.
For those who aren't getting enough vitamin D or zinc, returning the amounts of these nutrients in the body to normal levels can indeed increase long-term testosterone levels. A study by Stefan Pilz and his collaborators, as published in the journal Hormone and Metabolic Research states, ""In overweight men with deficient vitamin D status a significant increase in testosterone was observed after intake of 83 Î¼g vitamin D daily for 1 year whereas there was no significant change in men receiving placebo.""";up,frequently,stairs,product,though
Edexcel;A;4024 - Mathematics D;2013;Oct Nov;Did cancer exist before man-made chemicals were around to create it?;"Yes, cancer existed long before humans were able to create synthetic substances that cause cancer (cancer-causing agents are called ""carcinogens""). Unfortunately, cancer is a natural part of life. Every multicellular creature on earth can get cancer, even in the remotest locations (yes, even sharks get cancer). While some man-made chemicals can indeed cause cancer, they are not the only causes. Strictly protecting yourself from every man-made carcinogen will not guarantee that you will never get cancer.";"First of all, cancer is an umbrella term that encompasses hundreds of different diseases. What all of these diseases have in common is that normal cells are changed so that they begin to reproduce in an abnormal way, spreading through the organism and harming it. There is a vast array of mechanisms which can lead to cells reproducing abnormally. As with other biological processes, cell reproduction is ultimately controlled by the DNA of the cells. When a cell's DNA is changed, the cell is said to be mutated. Mutations are often harmless. However, if a mutation occurs in a portion of the DNA that controls cell reproduction, it can cause the cell to reproduce abnormally and pass on its mutation to the daughter cells. Any agent that leads to the mutation of DNA has the potential to cause cancer. Cancer-causing agents include (see the Notes Section at the end for more details):

Natural chemical carcinogens such as tobacco, alcohol, arsenic, and lead
Natural biological carcinogens such as the hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, and helicobacter pylori
Natural mechanical carcinogens such as asbestos
Natural radiological carcinogens such as radon, cosmic rays, and solar radiation
All of these carcinogens existed before humans developed the technology to create synthetic chemicals. Although human industrial activity can increase a person's exposure to natural carcinogens, this does not change the fact that these carcinogens are natural.

Even if you were somehow able to protect yourself from 100% of the carcinogens; whether natural or man-made; you could still get cancer. Cancer can form even when no harmful agents are present. Every time a cell reproduces, it must make copies of its DNA for its daughter cells. Due to the random fluctuations present in all molecular movements, copy errors can result during DNA replication even when no carcinogens present. In this way, DNA mutation is a natural part of cell replication. Many mutations are harmless. Some mutations are even beneficial and help drive evolution. However, mutations sometimes lead to cancer. Because of the presence of natural carcinogens in the environment, and because mutation is a natural part of cell replication, cancer happens even in the absence of man-made chemicals. Despite the fact that cancer is natural, we can certainly reduce our risk of cancer by avoiding tobacco, alcohol, arsenic, radon, ionizing radiation and other carcinogens; by eating more fruits and vegetables; by exercising regularly; by getting vaccinated; and by using sunscreen.

NOTES

Alcohol (ethanol), such as found in beer and wine, is the natural byproduct of yeasts fermenting sugar and can thus be found anywhere that yeast is found, including in overripe fruit and in palm tree sap. Alcohol is known to cause cancers of the mouth, throat, laryx, esophagus, liver, colon/rectum, and breast (source).

Arsenic is a chemical element found in many natural minerals. Natural arsenic is known to seep into groundwater, contaminating water sources used by humans, especially in regions of the world where natural arsenic levels are high. Arsenic has been found to cause cancers of the lungs, bladder, kidney, and skin (source).

Asbestos is a naturally-occurring silicate mineral that contains small, strong, needle-like fibers. When asbestos dust is inhaled, the fibers irritate and puncture lung cells, causing scarring and chemical imbalance that can lead to cancer. Asbestos is a mechanical carcinogen rather than a chemical carcinogen since it is the small size and hard, needle-like shape of the asbestos that enables it to damage cells rather than its chemical makeup. All minerals that have small, hard, needle-like fibers are suspected to be carcinogenic. Asbestos is known to cause cancers of the lungs, pleura, larynx, and ovaries (source).

Cosmic rays are high-energy particles emitted by distant supernovae outside of our solar system. Cosmic rays constantly rain down on the earth and have enough energy to ionize the atoms in biological cells, thereby potentially causing cancer. The earth's atmosphere provides somewhat of a shield against cosmic rays. However, people who spend a lot of time on airplane flights do not benefit as much from atmospheric shielding and have increased exposure to cosmic rays and solar radiation (source).

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacterium that grows in the mucus layer of the stomach. H. pylori has been found to cause stomach cancer (source).

Hepatitis B virus is a virus that affects humans who are exposed to infected bodily fluids. This virus has been found to cause liver cancer (source).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that has been found to cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. Additionally, HPV has been found to cause cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, and anus (source).

Lead is a chemical element that occurs naturally in minerals, soil, plants, and animals. Since lead is a stable, solid metal under standard conditions, exposure to lead usually occurs through ingestion or inhalation. Lead likely causes lung cancer and stomach cancer, although the evidence is not yet conclusive (source).

Radon is a natural radioactive chemical element that is produced by the decay of radium in soil and rocks. As a gas, radon tends to collect in enclosures close to the ground, such as basements. Radon decays to other radioactive isotopes which decay and emit ionizing radiation. Radon is known to cause lung cancer (source).";"Solar radiation contains ultraviolet radiation which damages skin cells. Ultraviolet radiation is also emitted by tanning beds. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation is known to cause skin cancer (source).

Tobacco, such as found in cigarettes and cigars, comes from the leaves of the tobacco plant. Tobacco is known to contain at least 50 different chemicals that cause cancer. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable cancer. It has been found to cause lung cancer as well as cancers of the mouth, lips, nose, sinus, larynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, uterus, cervix, colon/rectum, ovary, and blood (source).";behavior,faster,double,parallel,natural
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2015;Oct Nov;"Do humans give off radiation?
";Yes, humans give off radiation. Humans give off mostly infrared radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation with a frequency lower than visible light. This effect is not unique to humans. All objects with a non-zero temperature give off thermal radiation. And because a temperature of exactly absolute zero is physically impossible, all objects give off thermal radiation.;"We have to be careful here. Thermal radiation is not the exact same thing as infrared radiation. ""Thermal radiation"" is all the electromagnetic waves given off by an object because of its temperature, and includes radio waves, infrared waves, and even visible light. Infrared waves are only one part of thermal radiation. The two tend to get confused because most of the thermal radiation is infrared radiation for temperatures that are comfortable to humans. As an object gets hotter, the peak of its thermal radiation shifts to higher frequencies. The sun is hot enough that most of its thermal radiation is emitted as visible light and near infrared waves.

Thermal radiation only transports heat and indicates the temperature of its source. Different people at different times give off different amounts of radiation. But these differences just indicate who is hotter, and not who is fatter, taller, sadder, or more saintly. Thermal images of a person captured using an infrared camera just indicate the temperature of the person's skin, and cannot be used to diagnose diseases happening below the skin. Clothes tend to block infrared radiation, so a man with his shirt off emits more radiation than when it is on. Anybody who has tinkered with an infrared camera can attest to this fact.

Infrared radiation is non-ionizing and therefore cannot give you cancer. It's a good thing, because the rocks, trees, chairs, tables, and walls around us are constantly flooding us with a barrage of infrared radiation. For the most part, humans do not emit other forms of radiation besides thermal radiation. People often eat trace amounts of radioactive minerals that occur naturally, and they therefore give off tiny amounts of other types of radiation. For instance, Brazil nuts and bananas contain higher amounts of radioactive elements. But the amounts are too small to be noticeable or have an effect on their health.";"If a person has a medical scan taken that requires drinking radioactive contrast, he will emit more radiation than normal for a few hours until the contrast decays, but the amounts are still too small to have an effect on everyday life and health.

Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2017;Aug Sep;"Does licorice cause high blood pressure?
";Yes. Consumption of licorice (liquorice) can lead to dangerously high blood pressure and dangerously low potassium levels (hypokalemia). Licorice contains glycyrrhizinic acid, which sets off a well-understood chain reaction of biochemical events in the body resulting in high blood pressure.;"In a healthy person, the kidney excretes excess potassium into the urine in response to the hormone aldosterone. Interestingly, the hormone cortisol is chemically similar enough to aldosterone that it can also make the kidneys get rid of potassium. But cortisol is not part of the aldosterone/potassium feedback loop, so the ability of cortisol to act on the kidneys is a bad thing that could lead to abnormally low potassium. To prevent this from happening, the body has a specific enzyme (HSD-11Î²) that breaks down cortisol in the kidney before it has a chance to hijack the aldosterone receptors. The key here is that the glycyrrhizinic acid in licorice deactivates the protective enzyme in the kidney. Without this enzyme present to break down cortisol, cortisol successfully signals to the kidneys to get rid of potassium. Because cortisol is outside of the normal potassium feedback loop, the cortisol continues to tell the kidneys to get rid of potassium even after body potassium levels have dropped dangerously low. Eating licorice therefore leads to lowered potassium levels.

Potassium is an element that becomes a strongly positively-charged ion when in a dry salt or dissolved in water. The human body takes advantage of this property by using potassium to regulate fluid balance and to pass electrical signals along neurons. Low potassium levels therefore lead to fluid inbalance and interruption of nerve transmission. The end results of licorice overdose are high blood pressure, muscle cramping, muscle pain, muscle weakness, heart arrhythmias, constipation, impaired breathing, and even paralysis and heart failure. If caught in time, taking potassium supplements and avoiding licorice can quickly return the body to healthy functioning.

The licorice discussed here is true, unmodified licorice from the licorice plant, which contains glycyrrhizinic acid. Many popular candies that are labeled as ""licorice"" these days either contain no true licorice (they contain artificial flavors instead) or have the glycyrrhizinic acid deliberately removed from the licorice. But some licorice candies do indeed still contain unmodified licorice. Furthermore, many herbal supplements and home remedies that list ""licorice"" or ""licorice root"" as an ingredient do contain the potentially dangerous glycyrrhizinic acid. Eating a small amount of authentic licorice on one day will not give you enough glycyrrhizinic acid to do much harm. Typically, you must eat a very large amount of licorice in one sitting (4 bags) or eat it every day for a couple of weeks before the glycyrrhizinic acid builds up enough to become dangerous. For someone who loves eating licorice or someone who is taking daily herbal pills with licorice, overdosing is very easy. A paper in the Journal of Human Hypertension states: ""We now know that the effects of eating liquorice depends on the dose but prolongation of the consumption from 2 to 4 weeks does not influence the response. The maximal blood pressure rise is reached after the first 2 weeks. These results are in accordance with previous studies, which reveal that the liquorice-induced hormonal changes can be measured as soon as 1 week after the start of consumption of 100 g of liquorice.""

The medical journals are peppered with accounts, such as this JAMA report, of patients eating too much licorice and ending up in the hospital:";The curious syndrome of pseudoaldosteronism caused by excessive licorice ingestion usually causes muscle weakness, hypertension, and paresis. The following case is unusual in that a previously healthy patient presented in fulminant congestive heart failure (CHF) after ingesting large quantities of licorice for one week. Report of a Case: 53-year-old man suffered shortness of breath, ankle edema, increasing abdominal girth, weight gain, headache, and weakness for one week. On the eve of his admission he sat in a chair all night, unable to sleep lying down. He had been in excellent health, was taking no medications, and had never been previously hospitalized. He had always been a heavy salt and water user. He had eaten 700 gm of licorice candy beginning nine days earlier, having consumed the last piece one day prior to admission... An x-ray film of the chest (Figure) showed the heart size to be at the upper limits of normal with pulmonary vascular congestion and a right basilar pleural effusion. With a 2-gm sodium diet and bed rest, but no medications, the patient lost 12 lb over the next four days by diuresis. Needless to say, further licorice was withheld. He became asymptomatic, the x-ray film of the chest improved, the T-wave changes on the ECG became normal, and the blood pressure returned to a normal of 128/ 80 mm Hg. Four days after admission he was discharged.;nuts,plural,laid,danger,behavior
Cambridge;O;2210 - Computer Science;2015;Jan Feb;"How can Lyme disease last for years?
";"If treated, Lyme disease does not last for years. However, for some people, the after-effects of the disease can linger for months and sometimes even years. Alternative medicine providers call this condition ""Chronic Lyme disease,"" but this title is simply wrong. For a person who has been infected with Lyme disease and then treated, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease is measurably no longer present in his body, even though he may still feel some symptoms. The correct title for this condition is therefore ""Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome.""";"Lyme disease is an infection caused by a bacteria known as Borrelia burgdorferi. This bacteria is delivered to humans through tick bites. From the bite site, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. Usually, but not always, an infectious tick bite causes a characteristic red rash at the site of the bite. Other symptoms include fever, muscle soreness, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. In a few cases, symptoms can also include mood swings, memory loss, and sleep disturbance. If left untreated for too long, Lyme disease can lead to nerve damage, thereby causing shooting pain, numbness, and even paralysis.

The good news is that since Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, antibiotics do a good job of eliminating the disease. Taking antibiotics for one to four weeks, as directed by a doctor, successfully kills all the Lyme-disease bacteria in the patient's body. Unfortunately, a small percentage of people continue to feel symptoms for many months or even years after these bacteria have been eliminated. For such a person, calling his condition Chronic Lyme disease is incorrect since Lyme-disease bacteria are no longer present in his body. Also, since there are no Lyme-disease bacteria in his body, giving such a person more antibiotics over the course of months and years accomplishes nothing.

Researchers do not currently know conclusively what causes Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome. There are two likely culprits: residual tissue damage and auto-immune malfunction. As mentioned earlier, the Lyme-disease bacteria can damage nerves. Depending on the amount of damage, it can simply take months for the nerves to heal, even long after the bacteria are gone. The good news is that they eventually do heal. Almost all people with Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome eventually feel better. The other possible culprit is an auto-immune disorder that is triggered by the Lyme disease. The patient's own immune system works so hard at killing off the infectious bacteria that it ends up attacking the patient's own healthy cells long after the bacteria are gone. Again, most people that experience this effect eventually feel better after several months.

Unfortunately, many of the symptoms of Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome; muscle soreness, joint pain, headache, fatigue, malaise, etc.; are vague symptoms that could be caused by many other conditions. Lupus, Crohn's disease, HIV, fibromyalgia, CFS, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis are all conditions that could be easily mistaken as Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome. For this reason, the number of people misdiagnosed with Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome or ""Chronic Lyme disease"" is likely high. Fortunately, a simple blood test for elevated levels of the corresponding antibody can determine whether a person has had Lyme disease, even if the Lyme-disease bacteria are no longer present. Since antibody levels can stay elevated long after the bacteria that triggered them are gone, a positive antibody blood test does not mean that a person currently has Lyme disease, just that he has had Lyme disease in the past.

Some alternative medicine providers use the phrase ""Chronic Lyme disease"" as a catch-all diagnosis for any person experiencing general fatigue. Such a diagnosis is neither logical nor helpful. If a patient did not receive a tick bite, did not develop a rash, does not have the other symptoms, and does not have positive blood tests, there is no scientific reason to assume that the patient has Lyme disease or has ever had Lyme disease. Misdiagnosing a patient prolongs the time before he is able to find and treat the real cause of his symptoms. Since the concept of Chronic Lyme disease as a diagnosis for general fatigue is not supported by scientific evidence, any website or publication that claims this should be approached with skepticism.

The CDC states,";"It is not uncommon for patients treated for Lyme disease with a recommended 2 to 4 week course of antibiotics to have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches at the time they finish treatment. In a small percentage of cases, these symptoms can last for more than 6 months. Although sometimes called ""chronic Lyme disease,"" this condition is properly known as ""Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome"" (PTLDS)...studies have not shown that patients who received prolonged courses of antibiotics do better in the long run than patients treated with placebo.";ranch,ought,dropped,word,sister

Edexcel;AS;1123 - English Language;2018;Aug Sep;"How do magnets heal?
";Magnets have no healing properties. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) employs very strong magnetic fields, far stronger than a household magnet can produce, and yet MRI's have no direct effect on the health of the patient (an MRI may have an indirect effect as a diagnostic tool).;"The iron in our blood is in far too low of a concentration to be affected by the weak magnetic fields of household magnets. Furthermore, the iron atoms in our blood are bound in heme molecules. The chemical bonds that hold the iron atom in the heme molecule interfere with the state of its electrons, causing the iron atom to lose its usual ferromagnetic properties.

The lack of healing properties for magnets has been established multiple times through controlled experiments. For instance, M.S. Cepeda and colleagues found that static magnetic fields had no effect on pain levels. A study performed by M.H. Pittler reviewing multiple experiments also confirmed the inability of magnets to heal. It's true that all materials (including oxygen and frogs) have some kind of magnetic response. The problem is that it takes very intense magnetic fields for this response to be significant. Household magnets, and even MRI's, are too weak to evoke any lasting effect in humans. The intense magnetic fields of an MRI are used to temporarily reorient the magnetic dipoles of protons inside the body for imaging purposes. After alignment, the protons quickly become unaligned due to natural thermal and biological motion, and the rate that they become unaligned can be used to image different tissues.";If a human were exposed to static magnetic fields that were strong enough to have a significant effect, the result would be harmful, not healing. Blood would build up in places where it is not supposed to, or even explode out of its vessels. Note that we are talking about static fields here, such as produced by permanent magnets. Changing magnetic fields can have significant effects, but once the field starts changing it's not really just a magnetic field anymore. It becomes an electromagnetic field. Electromagnetic fields only have an effect on biological tissue if they are extremely intense (such as sunlight giving you a sunburn or a laser cutting your eye), or if they are high frequency (such as X-rays giving you cancer). In any case, handheld permanent magnets create only static magnetic fields and not electromagnetic fields. The FDA considers any magnet that is sold with the claim that it has healing properties to be fraud, and litigates against such products.;not,flat,honor,cry,plan

";"Vaccines do not cause autism. No reputable scientific study has ever been able to link the two. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that ""there is no relationship between vaccines containing thimerosal and autism rates in children.""";"The Institute of Medicine conducted a scientific review of this topic and stated in their publication Immunization Safety Review that, ""The consensus of most scientific experts is that autism is generally caused by early prenatal exposures (such as to valproic acid (Moore et al., 2000) or thalidomide (Stromland et al., 1994)) or is linked to early developmental genes (Ingram et al., 2000; Persico et al., 2001; Wassink et al., 2001)."" This review committee concluded that ""the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The committee also concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism."" The one publication that made a connection between vaccines and autism was later shown to be fraudulent. The ongoing survival of this myth is perhaps due to the fact that the symptoms of autism first reveal themselves at about the same age that a child receives many vaccines (2-3 years old). According to Dr. Stanley Plotkin's book Vaccines, more lives have been saved by vaccines than by any other medical approach, including antibiotics. It would be irrational and unethical to throw out the life-saving application of vaccines based on an unproven link with autism.";;feel,them,sky,riding,nearer
Edexcel;A;2210 - Computer Science;2007;May Jun;"How do your intestines detox your body?
";The intestines are not the main organ that detoxifies the human body. That function is carried out mainly by the liver. It is the function of the intestines to absorb nutrients from the food you eat and excrete food that your body does not absorb. Although all cells have the ability to metabolize chemicals, it is mainly the job of the liver to metabolize chemicals that are particularly dangerous or that accumulate to particularly dangerous levels.;"The word ""detoxify"" (or ""detox"" for short) is a vague word that is loaded with many pseudo-scientific connotations. In a scientific context, the word ""detoxify"" means to remove or dismantle specific chemicals that can harm the body if their concentration is too high. One of the liver's primary functions is to dismantle and deactivate dangerous chemicals before they build up enough to do damage. The liver is the body's natural detoxifier. But the liver is not infinitely powerful. If dangerous chemicals get too highly concentrated for the liver to handle, or if certain dangerous chemicals enter the body which the liver can't handle at all, they can damage the liver and even cause death. For an over-dose of certain chemicals, manual detoxification carried out by medical professionals can deactivate the toxins or counter the effects of the toxins before they damage the liver. The point is that it's the liver that gets damaged when you swallow 50 Tylenol pills at once, not the intestines. Long-term over-consumption of alcohol can lead to liver failure, not intestinal failure, because it is the liver that is breaking down the alcohol.

The textbook Hepatotoxicity by Hyman J. Zimmerman states, ""The liver has long been credited with the responsibility for detoxification and considered the guardian of the body (1,2). However, appreciation of the protective role of the liver has been tempered by the recognition that some â€˜detoxifying' changes may result in harmful products (3-10).""";"The liver is a very hardy organ and does an amazing job of detoxifying the body. If a person is exposed to certain chemicals that the liver cannot handle, or to concentrations of chemicals that are higher than the liver can handle, then the person should be rushed to the emergency room immediately, since liver failure is often fatal. Doctors can manually remove some toxins from the blood using dialysis or can counter the effects of some toxins with other chemicals. In a worst case scenario, doctors can conduct a liver transplant to save the patient's life. If a person has neither an underlying long-term liver disease that requires medical attention, nor exposure to toxin levels that requires hospitalization, then the liver is doing its job of detoxification just fine. Generally healthy people don't need to have their livers or their bowels ""cleansed"", as many pseudo-scientific advocates claim. Do-it-yourself ""detox diets"", ""bowel cleanses"", and ""liver cleanses"" are non-scientific. They do nothing to detoxify your body of dangerous chemicals. They are not supported by any scientific evidence, and they even lack any physically-plausible mechanism by which they could work. The Mayo Clinic states,""Detox, or detoxification, diets are popular, but they're not scientifically proven... there's little evidence that detox diets actually remove toxins from the body. Indeed, the kidneys and liver effectively filter and eliminate most ingested toxins.""";sitting,should,man,riding,feel

";Dust is more than just bits of dirt and sand from outside. In fact, any solid matter that is broken into small enough bits to be blown around becomes dust. Outside, common sources of dust are dirt, sand, pollen, and pollution. Indoors, common sources of dust include dead skin and hair cells from humans, the carcasses and waste products of microscopic creatures such as dust mites, as well as worn down bits of clothing and furniture. Dust is unavoidable because all solids slowly wear down. However, indoor dust can be minimized through a variety of techniques:;"Replace carpeting with hardwood or tile floors to make it easier to remove the dust.
Frequently wash places where dead skin accumulates such as bed sheets, blankets, pillows, and couches.
If necessary, place pillows and mattresses inside zippered dust covers that trap out the dust.
Wipe dust off of furniture, frames, and fixtures using moist paper towels. Using dry paper towels, reusable cloth towels, or feather dusters does not get rid of the dust but just redistributes it to other places.
Clean floors by either mopping or vacuuming with a vacuum that has a dust filter. Sweeping tends to just mix dust around without getting rid of it.
Use a high-quality electric air filter that traps dust.
Regularly clean or replace the air filter in the air vent system.
Store clothes and stuffed animals in sealed plastic bins so that the dust they generate stays trapped.
Use a dehumidifier machine to reduce the ambient humidity. Much of indoor dust is comprised of the waste of dust mites, who need moisture to survive and reproduce.
Reduce the dust tracked into the house by using door mats and taking off shoes and coats when entering the house.
Replace venetian blinds, which collect dust easily and are difficult to clean, with roller shades which can be wiped down easily when unrolled, or cloth curtains which can be washed in a laundry machine.";;personal,them,bend,differ,height
Cambridge;A;3204 - Bengali;2019;Aug Sep;"How does ice cream in your stomach cause a headache?
";An ice cream headache has nothing to do with your stomach, but is rather the result of the roof of your mouth (your palate) getting cold too quickly. In fact, you can get an ice cream headache before even swallowing the ice cream. Ice cream headaches occur whenever you eat or drink something cold too rapidly, and they last about 20 seconds.;Eating cold food slowly can give your palate time to cool down normally and adjust to the low temperatures without causing a headache. According to the Mayo Clinic, the exact mechanism at work in ice cream headaches is not currently known, but it is believed that the headache is a case of referred pain. When the roof of your mouth gets cold too quickly, the pain signal sensed in your mouth is passed on to the trigeminal nerve, which then passes it on to the brain where it is processed and experienced. The trigeminal nerve senses pain from the entire face and forehead, so when it gets overloaded, pain from your mouth seems to be coming from your forehead.;Ice cream headaches can be avoided by eating cold foods slowly, letting the cold food warm up before eating it, or by swishing a bit of the cold food around in your mouth before consuming the rest in order to help your palate adapt. If they do occur, these headaches can be alleviated by pressing your warm tongue against the roof of your mouth to warm it up, or by drinking a warm beverage.;nuts,height,third,its,pipe
Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2013;May Jun;"How does not washing your hands make you a healthier person?
";Avoiding hand washing will make you ill, not healthy. There seems to be a trendy viewpoint recently that having bad hygiene will make you healthier in the long run because it will boost your immune system by exposing you to more germs. This view is false, although it can be traced back to a true principle.;"The life-saving application of vaccines operates on the principle that if you expose your immune system to a certain germ, it will learn to recognize and build up an immunity against that germ that lasts for years. The trendy viewpoint therefore arose that having bad hygiene is like giving yourself mini-vaccines and will boost your immune system, making you healthier in the long run. This extrapolation from vaccines to bad hygiene is wrong for several reasons:

1. A specific vaccine only makes you immune to a specific disease, it does not boost your entire immune system in general. Vaccinating a child against measles will not make him immune to polio. That is why a child must receive so many different vaccines, that is, to protect him against all the major infectious diseases. Getting sick from a germ on your unwashed hands will only boost your immunity against that specific germ. But there are thousands (perhaps millions) of different types of infectious germs. The common cold alone can be caused by over 200 different viruses. To become immune to the common cold, you would have to get sick 200 times with each different strain of the virus. Even after doing that, you would still not protected for the reason mentioned next.

2. Germs evolve. When your body becomes immune to a certain germ, it is only developing immunity to the version that has infected you. Later versions of the same germ may have evolved into a different enough organism that your immune system is not able to recognize it. This is why the influenza vaccine must be reformulated every year. The influenza vaccine is updated annually to protect against the most current strains of the virus (or at least the most common current strains; it can't protect against all strains as the virus is constantly evolving into new strains). Getting sick from the a germ on your unwashed hands may make you immune to that particular strain, but will not make you immune to later versions that have evolved.

3. Vaccines consist of germs that have been altered to provoke the desired immune boost without giving you the disease. Germs on your unwashed hands have not been. To create a vaccine, scientists take a germ and either kill it, deactivate its toxicity, weaken it, or make a non-toxic copy. When the altered germ is injected into a patient, its molecular shape is learned and remembered through the production of antigen-specific antibodies. But because the germ has been rendered non-toxic, the patient reaps the benefits of immunity without actually getting the disease. In contrast, the germs on your unwashed hands are fully active and able to cause disease. You may develop immunity to a particular hand-borne pathogen, but you may also die or sustain long-term impairment in the process.

Hand washing has been one of the greatest advances in medicine. Before the concept of germs was developed, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis made an interesting discovery. As described in the biography written by Sir William Japp Sinclair, Dr. Semmelweis was working in the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840's when he found a discrepancy in mortality rates between the two different child-birthing clinics of the hospital. On average, about 10% of the birthing mothers in the First Clinic died of childbed fever, while less than 4% of the mothers died of childbed fever in the Second Clinic. Year after year, the mortality rate was consistently higher in the First Clinic. Word got out and laboring mothers begged to be admitted to the Second Clinic and not the First Clinic. Upon examination, Dr. Semmelweis discovered that the only difference between the two clinics was that the physicians in the First Clinic also performed autopsies, whereas those in the Second Clinic mostly did not. He reasoned that the deadly disease was being carried from the corpses to the birthing mothers on the hands of the physicians. Upon instituting a strict chlorine hand-washing policy in mid-1847, the fever death rate in the First Clinic dropped from 18% in April to 1% in July. In the following year, the death rate dropped to zero. Tragically, Dr. Semmelweis' discovery was ignored and ridiculed by the medical establishment of his time.";"The CDC states ""Keeping hands clean through improved hand hygiene is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others. Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water."" To stay healthy, you should wash your hands when preparing food, eating food, caring for an invalid, using the toilet, treating a wound, changing diapers, coughing or sneezing into your hands, and after touching garbage. Because of the immense impact of hand washing on health, many states and countries have laws requiring employees to wash hands before handling food and after using the toilet. The CDC estimates that about 500,000 children die each year as a result of not washing their hands. While we have focused on hand-washing in particular, these concepts apply broadly to all hygiene. Being lazy towards germs will make you less healthy in the long run, not more.";found,care,refer,further,planning
Cambridge;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2008;Aug Sep;"How long can you wait after dropping food on the ground to eat it without having germs attached? Some say it's a five-second rule, others say ten.
";"Germs immediately attach to food dropped on the floor. They don't have to wait five seconds to do anything. Germs are very sticky creatures; as soon as your food touches the floor, the germs stick, according to research done by P. Dawson as reported in the Journal of Applied Microbiology.";Dawson further found that significantly more bacteria is transferred to food dropped on wood and tile floors than on carpet. With that said, germs aren't just things that exist only on the floor. Germs are everywhere. If you took the tip of your average pencil and looked at it through an electron microscope, you would see a zoo of germs. Germs include bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as microscopic animals such as dust mites. They live everywhere: in your pillow, on your finger, in your hair, and in your stomach. Most of these germs are rather harmless. Additionally, the ones that are dangerous have to get past your skin to do any damage. That's why cuts should be treated to minimize infection, and why surgery is a sterile environment. Another way germs can get in is through your mouth. That's why it is not a good idea to eat food off the floor no matter how long it has been sitting there.;;younger,applied,universe,means,danger
Edexcel;O;5070 - Chemistry;2018;Jan Feb;"How long do you have to exercise for it to count?
";"Exercise starts to ""count"" the second you start to exercise. By the word ""count"", I assume we mean that the exercise is making you healthier. Every second of physical exertion makes you healthier, no matter what the activity is, or how long you have been doing it. It's not like the first twenty minutes of a run accomplish nothing and your body turns on once you hit the twenty-first minute of your run.";"A person who runs for ten minutes a day will generally be healthier than a person not running at all. Athletic trainers often recommend you exercise for at least a half hour in each workout. Such a recommendation does not imply that a twenty minute workout is useless and has zero health benefits. Rather, such recommendations are made in order to present a doable goal that brings significant health benefits. The situation is similar to practicing a musical instrument. Practicing the piano for only 10 minutes a day is not useless. But practicing the piano for 30 or even 60 minutes a day will accomplish a lot more.

For those of us who aren't seriously training, but instead just want to exercise for the general health benefits, consistently exercising a few times every week is far more important than reaching some magical number of minutes during a given workout. Many people have a hard time making the time commitment of 30 minutes exercise each day and end up skipping most of their workouts, thinking that any workout less than 30 minutes long is a total waste. In reality, every minute of exercise is beneficial. It is far more effective for those who are out of shape to focus on consistency and living a generally active lifestyle than to worry about reaching a certain total number of minutes of continuous intense exercise.

Furthermore, you don't have to go to the gym or pound pavement like a competitive athlete for an activity to count as exercise and benefit your health. Vigorous gardening, yard work, sight-seeing on foot, climbing stairs, hiking, walking, and throwing a ball around with the kids all count as exercise and promote your health. William Haskell of the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention published,";"""During the last decade a number of epidemiological or observational studies have been published demonstrating a strong inverse association between level of activity or physical fitness and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, the incidence of adult-onset or Type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and site-specific cancers. In many of these studies, the physical activity associated with the more favorable health outcome has been of light to moderate intensity, appears to have been performed on a more intermittent rather than continuous basis, and includes activities such as walking, stair climbing, gardening, and household chores more frequently than conditioning exercises such as jogging, cycling, and playing tennis... a person does not need to perform a bout of â€˜continuous exercise for 20 minutes or longer' (1990 ACSM guidelines) to achieve health benefits. Instead, it is proposed that performance of a whole serious of short bouts of activity spread throughout the day, if they total 30 min or longer, will provide significant health benefits.""";ought,riding,independent,coast,enjoy
Edexcel;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2007;Oct Nov;"How much extra radiation am I exposed to if I stick my hand in the microwave right after it turns off?
";ou are actually exposed to less radiation if you stick your hand in a properly functioning microwave oven right after it turns off. First of all, the microwaves emitted by a microwave oven are not harmful beyond their ability to heat you. Microwaves are non-ionizing, meaning that they do not have enough energy per photon to rip electrons off of atoms or break chemical bonds, which is what leads to cancer and radiation sickness. In fact, microwaves have far less energy per photon than the light from a candle or even the infrared thermal radiation from your hand.;"Microwave ovens emit electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of gigahertz (GHz). These are the same types of waves used by radars, cell phones, and WIFI routers. Microwaves can burn you if they are powerful enough and hitting you for long enough, but this is fundamentally no different from being burned by a campfire's thermal radiation. Sticking your hand in the microwave while it is on (which would require breaking the oven's safety features) and leaving it there is a bad idea because you will get burned.

Also, a properly functioning microwave oven automatically turns off the moment you open the door. The last bit of microwaves emitted by the oven bounce around inside and are absorbed within microseconds, long before you have even finished opening the door. By the time you stick your hand in the oven, the last bits of microwaves are long gone. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic waves, just like visible light. The microwaves in the oven disappear when the door opens just as quickly as a room gets dark when you turn off the light.";"The walls of a microwave oven are metal, which keep microwaves inside from leaking out. The oven is constructed to avoid leaking microwaves not because they cause cancer, but because that would be a waste of energy. The oven's job is to cook food; a job it would not do very well if its energy were leaking out into the room. Interestingly, the metal walls of a microwave oven also block a lot of external radiation (from the sun, stars, rocks, storms, etc.) from getting in. Because of this shielding effect, your hand inside a non-running microwave actually receives less radiation than your hand out in the open air. Either way, the radiation you are exposed to is so low-energy that there is nothing to be concerned about.";blue,bring,coast,furniture,especially
Cambridge;O;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2015;Jan Feb;"How often should hydrogen peroxide be used to treat wounds?
";Hydrogen peroxide should never be used to treat wounds as it does more harm than good. In fact, no antiseptic should be used to treat wounds. While highly reactive chemical agents such as hydrogen peroxide do indeed kill some bacteria, they do more damage to healthy cells that are attempting to heal the wound.;This fact has been known to mainstream science for almost 100 years. During World War I, military doctors followed medical folklore and treated soldiers' wounds with antiseptics, and yet the soldiers still died from infection at an alarming rate. Biologist Alexander Fleming approached the issue scientifically. According to the biography of Fleming written by Beverly Birch, Fleming discovered that those whose wounds were treated with antiseptics had higher death rates and slower healing times than those whose wounds were not treated at all. Surprised by this finding, Fleming conducted a controlled laboratory experiment that confirmed that antiseptics are harmful. In the years that followed World War I, scientists engaged in a hunt for a treatment that would kill the infectious bacteria without harming the patient's healthy cells or natural immune system. A decade after World War I had ended, Alexander Fleming discovered that Penicillin, a juice excreted by mold, selectively kills bacteria. Through the work of Fleming and other scientists, Penicillin was developed into a powerful medical treatment. The age of modern antibiotics had been launched. Because antibiotics kill bacteria without harming the body's cells, they can be taken internally and reach the bacteria below the skin's surface. Thus antibiotics proved useful in not only treating surface wounds, but also cured internal diseases caused by bacteria such as strep throat, syphilis, gangrege, and tuberculosis.;"If a wound is serious, the victim should seek out professional medical help, as the wound may require stitches. If the wound is minor enough to be treated at home, antiseptics such as hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, Purell, iodine, salt, or baking powder should never be applied to the wound. While antiseptics effectively kill bacteria with little harm when applied to the outside of healthy skin, they do more harm than good when applied to wounds. Instead, minor wounds should be pressed until the bleeding stops, gently rinsed with water, treated with antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin, and then bandaged to keep out dirt. The Mayo Clinic states, ""After you clean the wound, apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin to help keep the surface moist. The products don't make the wound heal faster, but they can discourage infection and help your body's natural healing process."" The A.D.A.M.

Edexcel;A;2210 - Computer Science;2007;Oct Nov;"I know anything from a plant is safe to eat, but anything from a lab can be dangerous. How can I tell if something came from a plant or a lab?
";"Not everything from a plant is safe to eat. Some of the most dangerous substances come from plants, not from laboratories. Cyanide is natural and is deadly. Backyard plants such as poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac should never be eaten. Mind-altering drugs like marijuana, tobacco, and cocaine all come from plants. Eighty four varieties of mushroom are toxic according to the book ""Clinical Toxicology"" by Marsha Ford.";"Even kidney beans are toxic when eaten undercooked, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (The FDA states that kidney beans must be soaked for at least five hours and boiled for at least ten minutes in order to deactivate the toxin. Slow cookers that do not bring the beans to a boil do not render them safe.) Many berries are poisonous, even ones on plants that otherwise provide edible substances, such as asparagus. Even deceptively beautiful plants such as wisteria, foxglove, or hydrangea will make you sick if ingested, according to the A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia. Too much licorice can give you dangerously high blood pressure. As another example, herbal tea made from poppy seeds has killed several people because of the lethal levels of narcotics that can occur naturally in the tea. In general, it is a good idea to not consume any wildflower, herb, berry, seed, mushroom, or herbal tea until you have done some research and are certain it is safe.

Additionally, just because someone has taken a plant, put it in a pill, and is selling it as an herbal supplement does not make it safe. Most herbal supplements are not regulated by the government the way medicine is. As reported by Dr. Anna Licata in her review study, ""Herbal Hepatotoxicity: a hidden epidemic,"" herbal pill sellers market their products as food and thereby avoid all drug regulations. They do this despite the fact that the herbs are used for their drug properties. Prescription medicine has strict safety measures in place at every stage of its existence: from the research and testing stage, to the drug approval stage, to the point where a licensed doctor prescribes it, and finally at the point where a certified pharmacist distributes it. Herbal pills have none of these safety measures in place. As Dr. Licata states, ""There is ample evidence indicating that herbs may have harmful effects and produce adverse interactions with prescription drugs as well. This would suggest that the side effects of herbal products are often underreported. Unlike prescription drugs, there are no databases linking herb consumption to later medical problems."" Eating water hemlock root, which is easily mistaken for parsnip, will kill you almost every time. Properly taking a prescription stomach acid reducer will never kill you. The bottom line is that plants and herbal supplements can be more dangerous than medicine from a lab because herbs have just as powerful drug effects but don't have the safety regulations in place.

Even if ""natural"" did mean ""harmless"" and ""healthy"" (which is a dangerous viewpoint), there is very little that is ""natural"" these days. Herbal supplements claim to be natural, and therefore healthy, but they have been processed and chemically altered to end up in pill form. Even chewing on a fresh tomato from your garden may not be as natural as you think. The tomato seeds you bought from the store are the culmination of centuries of human intervention including cross-breeding and other forms of genetic engineering. Eating a truly natural food would require moving to an unknown island that man has never touched and eating its wild herbs.";"But I wouldn't recommend it, as you would probably discover the experience to be neither harmless nor healthy. The misconception that ""natural"" always equals ""safe"" and ""man-made"" always equals ""unsafe"" extends beyond herbs. For example, some people may consider cell phones and microwaves dangerous because they are man-made. But the sun bombards humans with radio waves more consistently than cell phones, and with microwaves more consistently than ovens. Rocks in the ground and distant supernovae bombard the average human with more nuclear radiation than next-door nuclear power plants. The natural mineral named ""asbestos"" causes fatal lung diseases. Lightning bolts can electrocute people just as easily as downed power lines.

Edexcel;AS;2281 - Economics,;2010;May Jun;"Is fruit juice healthier than whole fruit?
";No, fruit juice is not healthier than whole fruit in general. Even if the juice is freshly squeezed on the spot, drinking the juice is less healthy than eating the fruit whole. You may be tempted into thinking that since fruit juice comes straight from the fruit, they must be nutritionally equivalent. But such thinking is wrong. There are two main reasons for this discrepancy.;"First, the pulp and skin of the fruit that is left behind is high in dietary fiber. Dietary fiber plays a larger role than just promoting regular bowel movements. When you eat a fruit whole, the dietary fiber in the pulp binds to the natural sugar in the fruit as it travels through your gastrointestinal tract. This binding action makes it harder and take longer for your body to absorb the sugar. As a result, the fruit's sugar accumulates in your blood at a lower and slower rate if you eat the fruit whole than if you drink straight fruit juice. This process lets your body use the sugar more as a direct energy source. In contrast, drinking straight fruit juice leads to a spike in blood sugar. Sensing that you have more sugar than you need, your body quickly releases insulin, leading to a large amount of the sugar in your blood being converted to fat and glycogen. In this way, the blood sugar spike leads to a blood sugar dip (unless more food is eaten), leaving you hungry again. And being hungry makes you eat more. In this way, drinking pure fruit juice leads to poorer regulation of blood sugar and increased calorie consumption, when compared to eating whole fruits. People who are especially sensitive to blood sugar levels may even suffer headaches, weakness, and irritability after drinking fruit juice, whereas these symptoms do not arise when eating the fruits whole.

A study lead by L. F. Burroughs published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition states, ""Healthy volunteers ingested sugar-equivalent meals of oranges and orange juice and of grapes and grape juice. Satiety, assessed by two subjective scoring systems, was greater after whole fruit than after juice and the return of appetite was delayed. With oranges, as previously reported with apples, there was a significantly smaller insulin response to fruit than to juice and less postabsorptive fall in plasma glucose."" Interestingly, a study lead by H. H. Stratton and published in the journal Pediatrics found that, ""Among children who were initially either at risk for overweight or overweight, increased fruit juice intake was associated with excess adiposity gain, whereas parental offerings of whole fruits were associated with reduced adiposity gain.""

Secondly, the pulp and skin of many fruits tends to be high in vitamins and other nutrients. Extracting just the juice leaves behind much of these nutrients. For instance, oranges are a rich source of flavonoids, but much of the flavonoids are stored in the pulp and not the juice.

The presence of dietary fiber and other nutrients in the fruit's skin and pulp therefore makes whole fruit significantly healthier than fruit juice. For instance, a study lead by Qi Sun of the Harvard Medical School and published in the British Medical Journal found that:";"Replacing each three servings/week of fruit juice consumption with the same amount of total or individual whole fruits, the risk of type 2 diabetes in the pooled analysis was 7% (95% confidence interval 4% to 9%) lower for total whole fruits, 33% (24% to 40%) lower for blueberries, 19% (14% to 24%) lower for grapes and raisins, 14% (11% to 18%) lower for apples and pears, 13% (9% to 16%) lower for bananas, and 12% (8% to 17%) lower for grapefruit after adjustment for personal factors, lifestyle, and the modified alternate health eating index score (figure). Additionally, we found that replacing fruit juice with oranges, peaches, plums, and apricots was also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: 18% (8% to 28%) lower for prunes, 11% (5% to 16%) lower for peaches, plums, and apricots, and 8% (4% to 12%) lower for oranges.

While drinking 100% fruit juice is certainly healthier than drinking soda pop or fruit-flavored beverages with artificial sweeteners, nothing beats drinking a cup of water and eating a whole fruit raw.";natural,valley,shut,adventure,brought

Essentially all medical doctors, scientists, research technicians, healthcare administrators, and politicians agree that vaccines are safe, effective, and lifesaving. This huge consensus among educated professionals was reached because of the large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of vaccines.;"The small but vocal minority that argues against the use of vaccines consists of non-scientific ""alternative"" healthcare peddlers and their gullible victims. A legitimate debate in educated circles requires evidence on both sides of the debate. Seeing as there is no evidence that vaccines fail or do significant harm, there is no real debate. Let us see what a legitimate scientific debate looks like and how it is resolved, and then look at some numbers.

By the end of the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell had successfully united all of the equations describing electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetic phenomena into one complete set of laws now known as Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations matched numerous experimental results and successfully united previously distinct fields such as electronics, radio waves, optics, and magnetism. Interestingly, Maxwell's equations describe light as electromagnetic waves. However, in the years between 1900 and 1910, the situation started to unravel for the wave theory of light. Max Plank demonstrated that experimental measurements of blackbody radiation (the light from glowing, hot objects) could only be accurately described by equations if light was taken to be composed of fundamental particles, and not waves. Furthermore, Einstein demonstrated in 1905 that the nature of the photoelectric effect (when light knocks electrons out of materials) could only be described if light consists of particles. A genuine debate ensued in the scientific community over the nature of light: whether it is composed of waves or of particles. There was solid experimental evidence on both sides of the debate. Some experiments showed that light is a wave and others showed that light is a particle. Both sides had sound theoretical treatments describing their respective experiments.

How does a genuine scientific debate like this get resolved? The only way forward is to develop a new theory that successfully describes all experiments. In the first few decades of the 20th century, Plank, Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, Schrodinger, Dirac, Pauli and many others did just that by developing quantum theory. Quantum theory has been mainstream science for almost a century and is at the heart of every laser and computer chip. Interestingly, quantum theory describes light as both a particle and a wave. More accurately, it describes light as something complex (a quantized probability wavefunction) that acts somewhat like a wave in certain ways and somewhat like a particle in other ways. Modern experiments routinely show that light can act like a wave and like a particle, at the same time.

The point is that genuine debates do exist in science, but they require substantial evidence on both sides, and they end up being resolved through more experiments and better theories. There is no way to resolve the vaccines ""debate"" because there is no evidence that vaccines are ineffective and harmful to begin with. There is therefore no genuine debate surrounding vaccines. A better description of the status of vaccines would be: A scientific consensus exists that vaccines are safe and effective, which is based on a large body of evidence, while a small vaccine-denialism subculture exists that has a hard time thinking scientifically. For vaccine denialists, an infinite amount of experimental evidence will never change their mind because they are not thinking scientifically to begin with. The existence of a science-denying subculture in educated countries is not unique to vaccines. There exists small pockets of people who believe cell phones cause cancer, the position of distant stars controls their destiny, and magnets have healing properties. But considering the life-saving property of vaccines, vaccine denialism is the most dangerous type of science denialism.

Let us look at some numbers. The rate of U.S. rubella infection in the year that a vaccine was released (1969) was 27 people per 100,000 as reported by the CDC. Within 10 years of distributing and administering the rubella vaccine, the rate had dropped to 2 people per 100,000. The current incidence of rubella in the U.S. is less that 0.1 people per 100,000. The CDC further reports that Polio was contracted at a rate of 10 people per 100,000 in 1955 in the U.S., the year Polio vaccinations began to be distributed. By 1975, the Polio infection rate had dropped to just 0.01 people per 100,000. The measles infection rate went from 400 thousand total cases in the year the vaccine came out (1963) to 20 thousand total cases five years later, and is now at less than 1 thousand cases per year. The mumps infection rate was at 90 people per 100,000 per year when the mumps vaccine was introduced and fell to 1 per 100,000 in 1984. The tetanus infection rate was at 2.9 cases per million people in 1955 and after several decades of vaccinations dropped to less than 0.3 cases per million. Because vaccines have been deployed in every country on the globe, vaccines are one of the largest scientific experiments ever run. After centuries of use by billions of people, the effectiveness of vaccines is one of the most verified science facts of all time. Considering that the effectiveness of vaccines is one of the most experimentally-verified science facts of all time, and that denying the effectiveness of vaccines is so life threatening, vaccine denialism is one of the most irrational beliefs a person can have.

In the 1950's, the smallpox virus was infecting humans globally at a rate of 50 million per year. After an intense global vaccination campaign lead by the World Health Organization that spanned two decades, smallpox was completely eradicated from the planet. The last case of smallpox was contracted in 1977 and there have been no cases since then, thanks to vaccines. Vaccine denialists claim that these drops in infectious disease rates are caused by better hygiene and access to vitamins. But this statement does not match the scientific data. The rates for infectious diseases that have no vaccine, such as Salmonella, are not dropping and in many cases have increased during the last 50 years, despite better hygiene and nutrition. The CDC retorts, ""Are we expected to believe that better sanitation caused incidence of each disease to drop, just at the time a vaccine for that disease was introduced?"" Such thinking is simply irrational.

Arguing against vaccines is not only unwise and unscientific, it is frankly unethical and deadly. An anti-vaccination campaign conducted in Stockholm in 1873 reduced the portion of the population that was vaccinated against smallpox from 90% to 40%. A smallpox epidemic ensued in Stockholm that did not abate until vaccinations became mandatory. Similar anti-vaccination-induced outbreaks happened in the United Kingdom in the 1970's with pertussis, in Sweden in the 1980's with pertussis, in North Dublin in 2000 with measles, in Nigeria in the 2000's with Polio, and in Indiana in 2005 with measles.

Some vaccine denialists argue that taking too many vaccines will overload, and therefore weaken, a child's immune system. But scientific evidence does not support this claim. Vaccines are used in a dead or inactivated form so that they don't actually infect the patient the way the original pathogen does. A child receiving a vaccine may feel mildly sick for a few days, but these symptoms are not because the vaccine is damaging his tissue. These symptoms are the natural effects of an immune system being activated (people with allergies know all too well what an activated immune system feels like). With vaccines, there is nothing for the immune system to actually fight. The body does not have to repair tissue after vaccination as no tissue is damaged (aside from the poke of the needle). The body's immune system creates antibodies in response to the vaccine that help it identify the real pathogen when it comes along. Some vaccine denialists mistrust vaccines because they don't seem natural. In fact, vaccines don't replace the body's immune system or directly fight viruses. Vaccines just activate the body's natural defense system by showing it what pathogens look like.";Young people in modernized countries today who don't read history books simply have no idea how different life was before vaccines came along. Before the polio vaccine was developed, whole communities of children spent their summer vacation in iron lungs, not at camp. One in four babies did not survive to their first birthday in the 1850's in the U.S. That number dropped to about 1 in 17 in 1935, and then to about 1 in 150 babies in 2007, thanks largely to vaccines. Thanks to vaccines, many young people in developed countries today have never experienced a serious infectious disease or seen anyone else experience a serious infectious disease. As a result, they may assume that serious infectious diseases are no worse than a head cold. They simply have no conception of the death and suffering that vaccines protect against. In the textbook Vaccines, Dr. Stanley Plotkinmore reports that more lives have been saved by vaccines than by any other medical approach, including antibiotics.;flat,fell,man,copper,refer
Edexcel;A;1123 - English Language;2007;May Jun;"What is the most harmful pseudo-science?
";"This question is rather subjective and depends on what you mean by ""harmful"". If you mean to ask which pseudo-science concept leads to the most bodily harm to humans, then the winner is definitely vaccine denialism. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines in protecting humans against specific diseases is one of the most experimentally-verified concepts of all time. Believing that the moon landings were faked may make you out of touch with reality, but this belief does not really harm anyone. In contrast, avoiding vaccines ultimately leads to disease and death.";"Furthermore, avoiding vaccines not only harms you, it harms your entire community because you spread dangerous contagions once infected. This fact is what makes vaccine denialism so insidious. No matter how trendy, popular, ""natural"", and attractive vaccine avoidance is made to appear, it does not change the scientific fact that vaccines save lives in a measurable, understandable, direct manner; and that vaccine denialism leads to disease, suffering, and death. Among all the different kinds of pseudo-science, vaccine denialism stands alone in a separate category because of the ability of viruses and bacteria to spread and mutate. Let's look at what makes vaccine denialism stand in a league of its own among the pseudo-science concepts.

1. Vaccine denialism leads the denialist to fail to protect himself from serious diseases.
Believing that free energy devices actually work will lead you to waste a few dollars on a useless electric gizmo but will not do much else. Using a magnetic health bracelet may not improve your blood flow, but it also won't hurt you. Believing that distant stars uniquely affect your personal relationships may cause you to make poor relationship decisions, but the belief won't cause you bodily harm. Believing that aliens from another planet have landed their UFO's on earth may lead to some awkward conversations at social events, but it won't cause anybody to get sick or injured. In contrast, avoiding vaccines ultimately leads to increased infection and bodily damage. Often when educated people meet a friend who believes in some form of pseudo-science, our response is to roll our eyes and change the subject, mumbling to ourselves, ""Whatever. He is free to believe this nonsense. It doesn't hurt anyone."" But when it comes to vaccine denialism, it does hurt people. Educated people therefore have a moral obligation to speak up against vaccine denialism.

Note that we should make a distinction between unknown science and pseudo-science. An instance of unknown science is a certain claim that has no experimental evidence supporting it but also no experimental evidence disproving it. For instance, scientists don't actually know what exists at the center of a black hole. Therefore, even though the belief that black holes contain ice cores may ultimately turn out to be incorrect, it is a perfectly reasonable and rational belief since there is no experimental evidence to disprove it. Such is the nature of unknown science. In contrast, an instance of pseudo-science is a certain claim that has ample experimental evidence disproving it. Belief in pseudo-science is therefore irrational since it requires the denial of physical reality. Vaccine denialism is the ultimate example of pseudo-science, since there is an unparalleled amount of evidence proving that vaccines are generally safe and effective. Every time one person receives a vaccine and is thereby protected from disease, that person becomes one more successful repetition of the vaccine experiment. Since billions of people have been vaccinated and protected over the last two hundred years, the effectiveness of vaccines is one of the most experimentally-verified concepts of all time.

2. Vaccine denialism is indisputably harmful.
Historical records spanning back 200 years, such as reported in the Social History of Medicine journal, make it clear that every time a community of people avoids vaccines, outbreaks of preventable diseases occur. We are not talking about winter colds here. We are talking about serious diseases such as measles and polio; diseases which can cause death and permanent disability. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles killed 2.6 million people a year globally according to the World Health Organization. In contrast, after years of widespread vaccination, measles killed 146 thousand people globally in 2013. Most of these deaths did not occur in regions of the world with high vaccination rates. For instance, the United States experienced zero deaths due to measles in the first eight months of 2013. Vaccine denialism leading to outbreaks of preventable disease is nothing new. Historical records show this phenomenon occurring repeatedly, stretching back over a hundred years. Sadly, some people fail to learn from history, have no knowledge of history, or actively deny history.

Vaccines are in an entirely different political category from the category that economic and social issues belong to. Whether a national tax break should be passed is a difficult question. The answer to this question depends on whether the majority of citizens value high personal incomes more, or whether they value government services more. Furthermore, there is no hard scientific evidence identifying one option as better. In this way, political debates about economic and social issues are largely driven by ideology, personal opinion, and political party tribalism. In contrast, there is indisputable scientific evidence that vaccines prevent serious harm. Therefore, there is not really a valid political debate about vaccines, since the evidence is all on one side. Politicians who promote vaccine denialism are not furthering a rational debate, since science settled this question long ago. Such politicians are instead displaying either scientific illiteracy or an intentional denial of reality. In either case, such politicians are not fit for office since vaccine denialism causes so much harm. When a person inserts vaccine denialism into a political discussion, you can be sure that rational discussion has ended and blind ideology has begun.

3. Vaccine denialism harms multiple people and not just the vaccine denialist.
Viral and bacterial infections are contagious. A person who becomes infected with a preventable contagious disease becomes a host from which the disease can be spread to others. As infected people sit at school, chat at work, ride the subway, attend sports events, grab snacks at shops, and enjoy rides at amusement parks, they are spreading contagions everywhere they go and endangering everyone they come close to. A vaccine denialist with measles will spread measles to the other vaccine denialists in his neighborhood, since they are similarly unprotected. Furthermore, he will also spread measles to the general public. How is this possible if vaccines are effective? There are four different mechanisms that make this possible.

First, no vaccine is 100% effective. Most vaccines are typically 80% to 99% effective, meaning that if 100 people get vaccinated, only 80 to 99 of those people are actually protected. Therefore, infected vaccine denialists will spread the disease to the 1% to 19% of the vaccinated population that is not effectively protected by their vaccinations. Second, viruses and bacteria that are thriving in an infected host have a chance to mutate. If they mutate enough they will not be stopped by vaccinations. If sufficient mutation occurs, the infected vaccine denialist puts 100% of the vaccinated population at risk. Third, young babies are not yet physically ready to receive all of their vaccinations. Even if the baby belongs to a pro-vaccination family, simply the state of being too young for full vaccination makes the baby potentially unprotected to the disease being spread by the infected vaccine denialist. Fourth, some people have malfunctioning immune systems and are unable to receive vaccinations or receive any benefit from them, even if they wanted to. In these four ways, vaccine denialism causes preventable disease to be spread through the general population. Vaccine denialism harms multiple people and not just the vaccine denialist.";This last point is what makes vaccine denialism so serious. When a person chooses to avoid vaccines, he chooses not only to potentially harm himself, he also chooses to potentially harm all those he comes in contact with, and all the people that those people come in contact with, and so on. When a person chooses to not wear his seat belt while driving, he is only putting himself at risk. When a person chooses to avoid vaccines, he is putting his whole community at risk. Vaccine denialism is not like one person deciding to not wear his seat belt. It is more like one random person forcing a large segment of his community to not wear their seat belts, despite their desires otherwise. As another metaphor, vaccine denialism is not like one person smoking a cigarette in his own home. Although smoking has been firmly established to be harmful to your health, it is still legal based on grounds of personal liberty since it harms no one else. In contrast, vaccine denialism is more like one random person forcing a large segment of his community to smoke cigarettes.;plus,free,found,bring,season
Cambridge;A;7707 - Accounting;2021;Jan Feb;"What part of the brain is hurt when you get headaches?
";Most headaches have nothing to do with the brain being damaged or strained. There is more to your head than your brain. Surrounding your brain are meninges, bones, muscles, skin layers, lymph nodes, blood vessels, the eyes, ears, mouth, nose and cavities called sinuses. Most headaches are caused by strain or pressure buildup in these other areas and not in your brain. Brain tumors and strokes can cause headaches, but they usually cause other more serious symptoms such as unconsciousness, seizures, paralysis, and vision loss.;For people with tumors or strokes, headaches are typically the least of their concerns. And even when a brain tumor does cause a headache, it does so indirectly by applying pressure to the skull and other parts of the head. In fact, the brain itself lacks pain receptors, so it is literally impossible to have pain in your brain. Surgeons can perform operations on the brain without numbing it for this reason. The brain is the place where we process and experience bodily sensations, so all pain ends up getting experienced in the brain. But all pain originates outside the brain. Sometimes a headache seems to be coming from deep within your head, but that is just a psychological/physiological trick where intense pain seems to spread out and come from other places than where it is really occurring. There are hundreds of types of headaches, all with different causes. For generally healthy people, the most common sources of headache are tension and head colds.;;say,bridge,free,try,cry
Cambridge;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2019;May Jun;"What should I do if I can't swallow pills?
";Virtually everyone can swallow pills. If you can swallow food, you can swallow pills. It just takes practice. For those with unusually large tonsils, an unusually sensitive gag reflex, and an unusually large pill to get down, swallowing may seem impossible. But even in such cases, swallowing down these pills can become easy and routine with practice.;"WARNING: children who are swallowing pills for the first time should only do so with adult supervision to avoid choking. Here are some tips for those having a hard time swallowing their pills:

Be patient and practice. For some people, it may take weeks until they get the hang of it.
Don't swallow pills with a dry mouth and throat. The pill will stick and scrape on the way down, making it harder. Take a sip of water before inserting the pill and swish the water around to get everything moist.
Put the pill on the center of your tongue and then take several small, quick drinks of water.
Distract yourself by watching television or a child or pet doing something cute so that you don't think about gagging, which will make you gag. Most pills are smaller than the chunks of food we regularly swallow, so the fear of gagging is irrational and can be conquered.
If the pill does not have to be taken on an empty stomach, take a few big bites of food before swallowing the pill. Eating will stretch your mouth and throat, stimulate saliva release to help things glide down, and suppress the gag reflex.
Swallow the pill quickly. If you let it sit on your tongue for awhile, it may start to dissolve, emitting a bitter taste that will trigger your gag reflex.
There are, however, many cases where swallowing down pills is not an option. For instance, a pregnant mother with sever morning sickness will just vomit up the pill before it can be completely dissolved. Also, young children have not developed enough to safely master the swallowing technique. Similarly, people with damaged throats, esophaguses, or stomachs may not be able to swallow pills. In such cases, tell your doctor and he or she will be able to prescribe a different form of medication that will be less convenient than pills but more manageable. The UK's National Health Service lists the following alternatives:";"a drinkable liquid
a dispersable tablet
a buccal tablet
a skin patch
a suppository (inserted in the rectum or vagina)

Edexcel;O;4024 - Mathematics D;2015;Jan Feb;"When someone's heart skips a beat, what is wrong with his heart?
";There is most likely nothing wrong with his heart. But a person with a heart that frequently skips beats should talk with his doctor to be safe. If the person has already told his doctor and has had some heart tests done that came back normal, then there is probably nothing wrong with his heart. The feeling of your heart skipping a beat or suddenly pounding, racing, fluttering, or throbbing is called palpitations.;"Perfectly healthy people have palpitations a few times in their life. If a person is having palpitations several times an hour, there is likely an underlying disorder or chemical stimulant causing them. Frequent palpitations can be caused by a wide variety of factors, many of which have little to do directly with the heart. Just because a heart test such as an echocardiogram comes back normal does not mean that you are imagining the palpitations. It just means that their cause lies outside the heart.

Common causes of palpitations in generally healthy people include:

Stress, anxiety, or panic
Excessive exercise
Dehydration
Low potassium, which can be caused by eating licorice
Low blood sugar (e.g. going too long without eating)
Acid reflux (heartburn)
Pregnancy
Menopause
Prescription medicine (palpitations are a side effect of some prescription drugs)
Over-the-counter medicine (some diet pills and cold remedies occasionally cause palpitations)
Caffeine, such as found in coffee, tea, colas, and ""energy"" drinks
Alcohol
Nicotine, such as found in cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco
Chocolate
Illegal drugs such as cocaine
Herbal supplements that contain ginseng, bitter orange, ephedra, valerian, hawthorn, etc.
If your heart tests come back normal and you are generally healthy, you will need to identify which of the above factors is causing your palpitations and eliminate it. For instance, start by going off (or at least reducing) coffee, tea, colas, and ""energy"" drinks for a week and see if the palpitations go away. If they do, you know that caffeine was the culprit. Permanently reduce or avoid caffeine, and the palpitations will stay away in this case. If you have cut out all sources of caffeine and the frequent palpitations do not go away, move on to the next possible factor. For instance, cut out smoking and drinking alcohol and see if that helps. Or, take a look at all of the prescription medicine and over-the-counter medicine that you take and see if palpitations are one of the side effects. Or, try developing a set daily routine of sleep, exercise, regular meals and regular drinking of water to see if your palpitations are caused by low blood sugar, dehydration, or stress.

Also be aware that many herbal supplements are marketed as entirely natural and harmless, but contain herbs that cause palpitations. If you are taking an herbal pill that is called ""ginseng"", then it is obvious that the pill contains a palpitation-inducing agent. But many herbal supplements are blends of herbs and have vague names such as ""All Greens"" or ""Colon Detox"". Such names give you no clue as to what the pills actually contain. You will need to go through the ingredients list to figure it out (if an herbal supplement does not come with an ingredients list, you would do best to avoid it, as it is likely a scam). See if any of the herbs listed below are one of the ingredients of any of the herbal pills you take.

Herbal supplement ingredients that can cause palpitations:

ginseng (ginseng root)
bitter orange (seville orange, sour orange, bigarade orange, marmalade orange, synephrine)
licorice (licorice root, glycyrrhizin)
caffeine (coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts, yerba mate, guarana berries, guayusa, yaupon holly)
alcohol
ephedra (ephdrine, pseudoephedrine)
phenylephrine
valerian (valerian root, garden valerian, garden heliotrope, all-heal)

Even though you may feel an occasional premature beat, it seldom means you have a more serious problem. Still, a premature beat can trigger a longer lasting arrhythmia - especially in people with heart disease.

";"Cold temperatures can affect your health, but they don't directly give you an infection like the common cold. Infections are caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Rhinoviruses are the usual cause of the common cold, as laid out by Ronald Eccles in his book ""Common Cold"".";"In order to make you feel sick, an infectious agent must get inside your body, and then get the upper hand on your immune system. While cold temperatures do not directly make you sick, the effect of cold on health is often under-emphasized my media reports anxious to debunk a myth. Dr. E. G. Mourtzoukou found that cold temperatures have significant effects on infection rates, as published in the journal article titled ""Exposure to cold and respiratory tract infections."" Cold air inhaled causes your respiratory tract to underperform. Additionally, cold temperatures force your body to divert more energy to staying warm, leaving less energy available to fighting germs. You may already have been exposed to an infection but not know it. Upon spending too much time in the cold, your body typically responds to the acute stress by signaling to your immune system to downgrade its activity, which may give the infection the chance to flourish. As a result, you start feeling sick. While the cold did not directly cause the sickness, it can make things worse. The bottom line? Don't roll around in the snow with your coat off if you're starting to feel sick. And don't spend a long time outdoors in very cold weather if your respiratory system feels irritated.";;using,chance,shut,push,not
Cambridge;O;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2018;May Jun;"Why do heart attacks always cause chest pain?
";"Heart attacks do not always cause chest pain. This is a dangerous misconception. While chest pain often does accompany a heart attack, sometimes it does not and the symptoms are less severe. The American Heart Association states, ""Although it's common to have chest pain or discomfort, a heart attack may cause subtle symptoms."" Common symptoms of heart attack include nausea, feeling light-headed, shortness of breath, anxiety, and pain in one or both arms, the back, neck, or jaw.";"Leading up to the heart attack, the person may have experienced unexpected fatigue, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or beats irregularly). If you experience these symptoms, even without chest pain, you should immediately seek out emergency medical help. While there are many other less-serious medical conditions that can cause these symptoms, it is better to play it safe.

A heart attack occurs when insufficient blood is supplied to the heart's muscle cells. Without the blood-delivered oxygen needed for the heart's muscle cells to operate, they malfunction and may even die. The problem is that the heart pumps life-sustaining blood to the rest of the body, so if it malfunctions, the entire body becomes oxygen-deprived. Such a state quickly leads to death. The decrease in blood supply to the heart is usually caused by blockage in a coronary artery by plaque build-up. The chest pain caused by a heart attack is a direct result of the heart muscle cells not receiving enough blood. This is similar in mechanism to when not getting enough oxygen to your skeletal muscles while exercising can cause them to cramp or spasm.";;plural,environment,free,behavior,congress
Edexcel;A;1123 - English Language;2014;May Jun;"Why do humans crave sugary foods? Shouldn't evolution lead us to crave healthy foods?
";Sugar is actually quite healthy when consumed in moderate amounts and in its natural form. The main natural source of sugar is fruit. In prehistoric times, vegetables were the most abundant foods and fruits were scarce in comparison. However, vegetables carry little energy compared to fruits. Therefore, the pre-human primates who consumed the most calories were the ones best able to stave off starvation and pass on their genes.;"Since fruits were relatively rare, the primates who ate the most of them were best positioned to win the battle of evolution. For this reason, genetic mutations that caused some of our ancient ancestors to crave sugary foods, and to be able to convert the sugar to body fat for future use, ultimately caused them to flourish. Simply put, early primates evolved to crave fruits precisely because these foods are so healthy in the small amounts that were available to them. Because it is more difficult to retrieve a fruit from a high tree than to just eat whatever grass or leaves are sitting around, an intense, innate craving for sugar was needed to drive early primates towards this food.

Now fast forward millions of years to our modern age. With improved agricultural technology, rich countries became able to grow fruits cheaply and in abundance. Instead of being rare caches of calories that could boost survival, fruits became staple foods that could be consumed anytime. The innate craving for sweet foods was still present in humans, but the scarcity of such foods was no longer a problem for many people, leading to over-consumption. This situation still holds true today in affluent nations. In short, the advancement of technology has made it easy for many of us to eat far more sweet foods than our bodies are able to handle. Craving and eating sugar in the amounts and forms that our ancient ancestors encountered is quite healthy. Craving and eating sugar in much larger amounts and in extracted forms is what is unhealthy.

Technology has not only enabled us to grow fruits in abundance, it has also enabled us to extract and concentrate the sugar in the fruits. If a raw orange tastes good mostly because of its sugar content, then the sugary juice squeezed out of the orange should taste even better. It does! If sugar is mostly what makes the orange juice taste so good, then boiling off some of the water from the juice should give you a sugary lump of gummy candy that tastes even better. It does! The problem with this extraction and concentration process is that each step along the way makes it easier for a person to eat too much sugar. It is possible to eat your way to obesity by consuming only oranges as your treat, but doing so requires eating dozens to hundreds of oranges a day. In contrast, it's much easier to eat a few bags of orange candies every day, or drink a pack of orange soda pop every day, and end up obese. In this way, concentrating sugar into sweet treats makes it very difficult to eat as much as you please and still stay healthy. Another problem is that the sugar which has been extracted from fruit is no longer bound to fiber, making it a spike-and-crash source of blood sugar rather than a steady source of blood sugar. Even freshly-squeezed orange juice is less healthy than a whole orange because the sugar has been separated from the fiber.

If you want to be healthy, you shouldn't completely ignore your evolutionary craving for sugary foods. Rather, direct this craving towards eating moderate amounts of whole fruits, while cutting back on candy, fruit juice, soda pop, and sugary baked goods.

Now, this thought process may lead you to ask, ""If eating too much sugar is unhealthy, shouldn't evolution eventually lead us to instinctively avoid eating too much sugar?"" The answer to this question is complicated. First of all, you are indeed right that humans are still evolving. However, genetic evolution is a very slow process that requires many generations. Humans have only been manufacturing sweets in abundance for a few hundred years, which may not yet be long enough for any kind of evolutionary change to be noticeable. Secondly, evolution is not a guiding hand that automatically forces organisms to want to do what is healthy. Rather, evolution is simply a description of the process by which groups with certain genetic changes that enable them to better survive their particular environment tend to cause these changes to spread in succeeding generations. There are many factors which could affect a modern human's ability to survive. For this reason, it is hard to predict what direction human evolution will take in the future. With that said, since over-consumption of sugar can ultimately lead to an early death, it's certainly plausible that over-consumption of sugar will be naturally selected against in the coming millennia.";This could lead to humans that innately no longer want to over-indulge in sweets. There are a few ways humans could evolve to avoid over-indulgence. For instance, the genes that produce a craving for sugar could simply disappear. Or, the human body could develop a mechanism whereby eating too much sugar triggers a painful or uncomfortable sensation, similar to how breathing in some water triggers an unpleasant choking feeling that drives you to cough. Whatever form the mechanism takes, it is certainly possible that future humans will evolve such that they no longer have a desire to over-indulge in sugar.;stand,model,faster,soon,cry
Edexcel;A;2281 - Economics,;2004;May Jun;"Why do women get more tooth problems during pregnancy?
";"Perhaps you have heard the old adage ""gain a baby, lose a tooth"". In this particular case, the old adage ends up being true, and the culprit is hormones. According to the Mayo Clinic, the higher levels of progesterone and estrogen in the mother's body help the baby grow but these hormones also weaken the bones and ligaments that anchor the teeth. Furthermore, these hormonal changes increase acid levels in the mother's mouth, which can lead to tooth decay.";The mother's gums will also tend to swell and bleed in response to progesterone, making them open to infection. The softening, loosening effect of the pregnancy hormones are good for the baby as they allow the baby to descend during birth with minimal constriction. But these effects are not as good on the mother's teeth. Additionally, as a JCEM journal article by Christopher S. Kovacs makes clear, the mother's hormones divert calcium away from her own bones and towards the developing bones of the baby. Pregnant mothers therefore have lower levels of calcium in their system, which can make for weaker bones and teeth. Some women are less sensitive to hormonal changes and will not experience worsening teeth and gum conditions. While good oral hygiene can minimize problems, the deleterious effects of pregnancy on oral health are not completely unavoidable. Worse teeth are simply part of the sacrifice that women make to bring a child into the world.;;clean,bridge,applied,nearer,sick
Edexcel;O;3204 - Bengali;2017;Aug Sep;"Why does chocolate cause acne?
";Chocolate does not cause acne. Acne is caused by overactive sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands are microscopic glands connected to the hair follicles. Their job is to secrete skin oil (sebum), which travels up the shaft of the hair and out onto the skin in order to waterproof the body. If the glands secrete too much skin oil, the channel along the hair's shaft becomes clogged. ;" As a result, a buildup of skin oil and dead cells occurs in the glands and the hair follicle. This stagnant, clogged mass just below the skin's surface becomes infected with bacteria and turns into a pimple. Sebaceous glands accelerate their secretions in response to high levels of sex hormones, such as present during puberty. The causes of acne are therefore: 1) elevated sex hormones, 2) sebaceous glands that are overly sensitive to sex hormones, and 3) the presence of bacteria that take advantage of the situation.

Chocolate has no effect on acne, according to a study done by Dr. James E. Fulton. Dr. Fulton divided 65 subjects with mild acne into two groups; one group had people eating chocolate bars, and the other had people eating bars that looked like chocolate but contained no chocolate. In the end, there was no difference in the acne of the two groups. Though chocolate does not affect acne, anything that raises the levels of sex hormones will worsen acne. For example, using testosterone replacement therapy to boost abnormally low testosterone levels can worsen acne. For women, menstruation leads to fluctuations in hormone levels and can therefore worsen acne. Because of the three factors that combine to cause acne, various treatments work by addressing one or many of these factors.";Some treatments lower sex hormone levels, while others kill the bacteria. Also, some treatments work by widening the follicle shafts to reduce blockage.;difficulty,subject,word,buffalo,again
Edexcel;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2007;Aug Sep;"Why does mainstream medicine only treat patients with drugs?
";Mainstream medicine does not only treat patients with drugs. Mainstream medicine encompasses all techniques that have been shown by credible evidence to successfully promote and protect human health.;"This includes surgery, physical therapy, exercise, balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, preventative care, counseling and lifestyle changes. Preventing illness, treating acute conditions, and promoting general health through non-drug measures is a core part of mainstream medicine, and always has been.

If you break your arm, a competent mainstream doctor will set the bone back into place and then construct a cast around the arm to immobilize it. He won't just hand you pills and send you back home. He may give you painkillers to help you handle the pain, or antibiotics to protect against infection, but these drugs aren't healing the broken bone. The broken bone heals itself naturally when the bone is properly set in place and protected from further damage and infection. Mainstream doctors know that the human body has the innate ability to naturally heal broken bones, and that is why they treat fractures with casts instead of drugs.

If you get a deep cut in your leg, a competent mainstream doctor will stitch or medically glue your skin back together. She won't send you home with just drugs. Again, the point is that the doctor applies a treatment that aids your body's own natural healing mechanisms.

If you suffer from joint pain (bursitis), a mainstream doctor will teach you specific motions and exercises that will aid the body in its healing.

The list goes on and on. If you have a vitamin deficiency caused by poor nutrition, a mainstream doctor will instruct you on how to have a balanced diet. If you are allergic to peanuts, a mainstream doctor will instruct you on how to avoid peanut-containing foods. If you have sleep apnea, a mainstream doctor will most likely have you try using a breathing machine at night. If you suffer from post-partum depression, a mainstream doctor's first approach will most likely be signing you up for professional counseling. If you have headaches from overusing caffeine, a mainstream doctor will help you develop a plan to reduce caffeine consumption.

Furthermore, mainstream doctors instruct their patients in preventative care. They tell their patients to quit smoking, to get more exercise, to be screened for diseases and risk factors, to avoid drug abuse, to be up to date on vaccines, to cut back on alcohol over-use, to avoid risky sexual behavior, etc. Any approach that has been demonstrated by credible evidence to improve, protect, and promote human health is part of mainstream medicine and is used by competent doctors.

The misconception that medical doctors only use drugs is most likely the result of two factors. First, there are indeed a few medical doctors who often skip all the other options and go straight to prescribing drugs. They may be too over-scheduled to talk to you about lifestyle changes, or may assume that you are already know about the non-drug approaches. Whatever their excuse may be, the few doctors that act like this are simply failing to use the full resources of modern, mainstream, evidence-based medicine. They are therefore not representative of mainstream medicine in general. Fortunately, such doctors are rare. If your primary care doctor never talks to you about exercise, nutrition, screenings, or vaccines, that just means it's time to find a new doctor. Unfortunately, the incomplete approach of a few oddball doctors can taint the entire profession in some people's minds, leading them to think that doctors only use drugs.

Secondly, there has unfortunately arisen a large array of non-evidence-based healthcare providers who twist the truth in order to generate more business. In order to justify the use of their products and services, they co-opt mainstream medicine's non-drug approaches and pretend that only they provide such approaches. ""Doctors only use drugs, so come to us to find a more natural approach to healing!"" This is a common falsehood promoted by such scammers. Unfortunately, they have been somewhat successful in their misinformation efforts. Many people now see exercise, nutrition, counseling, lifestyle changes, preventative care, and natural healing as outside the realm of mainstream medicine, which is absurd.";"Note that none of this explanation is meant to imply that the use of prescribed drugs is always a bad idea. For many situations, prescribing a drug is the best approach. In many cases, a mainstream doctor is correct in going directly to that option. For acute blood-sugar episodes in diabetics, insulin injections really are the best approach. For a severe allergic reaction, an epinephrine injection really is the best option. In such situations, avoiding drugs and looking for a ""more natural approach"" could be deadly. Prescribing a drug is not automatically a sign that a doctor has failed to pursue a more effective non-drug approach.";under,planning,enjoy,try,tightly
Edexcel;O;7010 - Computer Studies;2018;Aug Sep;"Why don't dark-skinned people get sunburns?
";Dark-skinned people do get sunburns. While it's true that the higher pigment levels that make certain people's skin look dark helps protect against sunlight, the pigments do not block 100% of the light. The skin pigment melanin is produced by special skin cells called melanocytes to protect the body from the damaging effects of ultraviolet light. Higher levels of melanin means less sunburn and less skin cancer.;"But even the darkest-skinned person is not protected 100% from sunlight. A 2010 CDC study found that 13% of black women and 9% of black men reported getting at least one sunburn in the past year. Furthermore, 38% of Hispanic women and 32% of Hispanic men reported getting at least one sunburn in the past year. For comparison purposes, the average value across all ethnicities and genders was 50.1%. While dark-skinned people definitely get fewer sunburns, they still get them. When a dark-skinned person gets a sunburn, it may not be visually noticeable, but the damage is still there. A dark-skinned person with a sunburn still experiences the skin tightness, pain, sensitivity, heat, and peeling that light-skinned people experience.

Because dark-skinned people get sunburns, they also get skin cancer from sun exposure. The rates of skin cancer for dark-skinned people are far below that of light-skinned people, but the rates are not zero. Another CDC study found that about 1 in every 100,000 black people gets skin melanomas each year and about 4 in every 100,000 Hispanic people get skin melanomas each year. Dark-skinned people have a higher chance of getting skin cancer from sun exposure than of winning the lottery. But, unlike the lottery, dark-skinned people have a way to drastically alter their odds. Sunscreen protects dark skin against sunlight damage just as well as it protects light skin.";About 1 in every 200,000 black people dies from skin cancer each year and 2 in every 200,000 Hispanic people die from skin cancer each year. For comparison purposes, about 6 in every 200,000 white people die from skin cancer each year.;not,aboard,environment,seat,add
Edexcel;A;5070 - Chemistry;2021;Aug Sep;"Why isn't there just one cure for cancer?
";"There is not one cure or treatment for cancer because cancer is not a single disease. The word ""cancer"" is an umbrella term that includes hundreds of different diseases. Furthermore, cancer is typically harder to battle than infectious disease because there is no foreign agent attacking the body which can be distinguished from the healthy parts of the body. Instead, cancer involves the body's own cells doing the damage. ";"Therefore, there are just as many different types of cancer as there are different types of cells in our bodies. This means that the type of treatment that is most effective will depend on 1. where the cancer exists in the body, 2. the type of cancer, and 3. how far along the cancer is. In an introduction to the publication titled ""Nature Insight: Cancer"", the senior editor Bernd Pulverer states, ""Cancer is an umbrella term covering a plethora of conditions characterized by unscheduled and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. As the average age in many countries steadily rises, so do cancer-related deaths, so that cancer will be one of the most common causes of death in the 21st century. Almost any mammalian organ and cell type can succumb to oncogenic transformation, giving rise to a bewildering array of clinical outcomes.""";For example, thyroid gland cells take in the dietary element iodine more than other cells in order to produce thyroid hormones, which contain iodine atoms. Papillary thyroid cancer cells can therefore be destroyed by giving the patient radioactive iodine (iodine-131). When the patient drinks the radioactive iodine, it enters the bloodstream and then becomes concentrated in the thyroid cells. When this radioactive version of the element undergoes radioactive decay inside the thyroid cells, radiation is released which destroys the cells. In this way, iodine-131 can be used to treat certain thyroid cancers. At the same time, radioactive iodine cannot be used to treat prostate cancer, because prostate cells do not significantly take in iodine.;care,say,double,before,region
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2015;Aug Sep;As light from a star spreads out and weakens, do gaps form between the photons?;The answer depends on how you look at light. However, in the most accurate approach, gaps do not form between photons as light spreads out. Light is made up of tiny fundamental bits called photons. A photon is a quantum object. As such, a photon acts a little like a particle and a little like a wave, but is actually something more complex.;"If you look at light as a collection of little particles, you could say that dimmer light has its photons more spread out. But, they are not spread out in space while traveling. Rather, they are spread out in time and space as they are received. A sufficiently sensitive photon counter device can detect the reception of light one photon at a time. Shine light at such a device and it does not receive the light as a steady stream. Rather, it receives the light as a series of discrete bundles of energy separated by gaps in time. Similarly, shine light at a sufficiently sensitive array of photon counters, and it receives the light at point locations with spatial gaps between them. When viewed in this way, a light beam always has gaps between its photons, whether the light be very bright or very dim. Very dim light beams have larger gaps in time and space between the reception of each photon compared to brighter light beams. Light from a very distant star has spread out over a very large area and become very dim in the process. The gaps between photon reception from a very distant, dim star are therefore large. Again, it is only the reception time and locations that has gaps. There are no gaps in space between the photons as they travel.

If you look at light as a wave, then there no gaps unless specifically placed there on purpose. Of course, if you repeatedly turn on and off a flashlight, the light beam coming from your flashlight will have gaps. Similarly, if you shine a continuous beam of light through a shutter that is repeatedly opening and closing, you can create gaps. But if you shine a continuous beam of light into free space, the wave will start with no gaps and therefore develop no gaps as it travels. Waves are field oscillations that are spread out smoothly through space. Spreading out a wave over a larger area just causes the wave strength to weaken, but does not cause gaps to form. Therefore, if you look at photons as waves, spatial gaps never form in light as it travels through free space, no matter how dim it gets. The light from a distance star indeed spreads out and weakens as it travels, but this just reduces the wave strength and does not introduce gaps.";A rough but helpful way to look at photons is that they act like waves while traveling and act like particles when interacting with matter. In the context of starlight, the light travels through space for millions of years acting like a wave, and then acts like a collection of particles when hitting the photon detector, the telescope, or an eye. Each photon therefore collapses from mostly wave-like to mostly particle-like upon being detected. Since the photons act mostly like waves while traveling, there are no gaps that develop between them while traveling. And since the photons act mostly like particles when being detected, there are gaps in the time when the photons are detected and in the locations where they are detected. The act of detecting the light causes it to collapse from wave-like to particle-like, and therefore introduces the gaps. A very dim light beam from a distant star has a very weak wave magnitude, which leads to large gaps in photon reception.;animal,sky,town,valley,syllable
Edexcel;O;3204 - Bengali;2010;Jan Feb;"Can a fire have a shadow?
";"Yes, you can form the shadow of a fire, but perhaps not for the reason that you are thinking. A shadow is formed any time part of a light beam is blocked or redirected. The shadow region is the region in the light beam where there is less light than in the rest of the beam. This dimmer region tends to take on the shape of the object that is blocking or redirecting some of the light, so we tend to think of a shadow as something that is cast or created by the intercepting object. With this concept in mind, in order for a fire to have a shadow, the fire needs to somehow block or redirect part of another beam of light.

";"A traditional flame can block or redirect light just fine for the simple reason that a traditional flame is more than just a pillar of light. A traditional hydrocarbon flame contains several components: hydrocarbon fuel molecules and oxygen molecules that are in the process of burning, little solid bits of half-burnt fuel and impurities (called soot or smoke), carbon dioxide and water vapor produced by the burning, light, and hot air. The light that you see in the flame is mostly created by the solid bits of airborne soot heating up so much that they glow via regular incandescence. The interface between the hot air in the flame and the colder surrounding air tends to bend light away from its forward-propagating direction. This deflection of light at the interface of different materials is called refraction. It is the same effect that enables a lens to focus light. Therefore, for the simple reason that a flame contains hot air, it is able to deflect away some of the light in a light beam and cast its own shadow. Hot air tends to rise turbulently. For this reason, shadows created by hot air tend to look like a bunch of dancing ripples. Also, the soot in a flame can absorb light and can therefore also contribute to the creation of a shadow of the flame.

To actually notice the shadow of a fire, the light beam that is going past the fire (e.g. sunlight) must be about as bright or brighter than the light created by the fire itself. Otherwise, the light created by the fire, which spreads out in all directions, will overpower and fill in any dim region created in the other beam of light. For example, pointing a weak flashlight at a roaring campfire will not enable you to see the shadow of the fire. Also, the smaller and cooler a flame is, and the less soot it has, the less it absorbs and redirects light, and therefore the dimmer its shadow will be. Depending on your particular setup, you may or may not be able to see the shadow of a flame with your naked eyes. For best results, you should use a bright light beam, such as direct sunlight, and a fire with lots of heat and soot.";Note that fire can have a shadow not because the incoming light beam scatters off the light in the flame. On the fundamental level, one beam of light cannot directly interact with another beam of light. Light beams never directly bounce off each other, absorb each other, or deflect each other. This is because light consists of quantum particles called photons which are by nature bosons. All bosons are able to overlap with each other, pass through each other, and occupy the exact same state at the exact same location. This is also because photons carry neither electric charge nor magnetic moment. Electromagnetic fields, such as those which constitute light, can only interact with objects that carry electric charge or a magnetic moment. Without any charge or magnetic moment to interact with, one bit of light cannot directly influence in any way another bit of light. Note that one light beam can indirectly deflect another light beam by changing the material that both beams are traveling through, or through more exotic effects, but such effects are not present in traditional flames. Fires can have shadows because they contain hot air and soot, and not because they contain light.;cry,browserling,planning,properly,its
Edexcel;O;5070 - Chemistry;2005;Jan Feb;"Can air make shadows?
";Yes, air can indeed make shadows. A shadow occurs when an object in a light beam prevents some of the light from continuing on in the forward direction. When the light beam hits a wall or the ground, a darker shape is visible where less light is hitting the surface. Both the light and the shadow, which is just the absence of light, travel to the surface at the speed of light. There are three ways that an object can prevent light from continuing on in the forward direction:;"Absorption. The light that hits the object is absorbed and converted to heat. A black table creates a shadow on the wall mostly by absorbing the light that hits it.
Reflection. The light that hits the object is reflected off the front surface and redirected to another part of the room. A silvery bowl creates a shadow on the wall by reflecting away the light that hits its front surface.
Refraction. The light that hits the object passes through, but the light's direction is bent by the object. If the direction is bent enough, the light that passes through the object will be angled out of the forward-traveling beam. As a result, the beam will have a dark spot; a shadow.
Consider completely transparent objects such as glass cups, bottles of water, or the lenses of eyeglasses. Even though such transparent objects do not absorb or reflect very much light, they still interact with light through refraction. Refraction is what makes transparent cups visible to our eyes. Refraction also enables clear objects to cast shadows. Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses.

Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform. Refraction happens at the surface of a glass lens because that is the only place where the index of refraction differs. Uniform air itself cannot refract light and create shadows because the index of refraction does not differ anywhere. But, when different regions of air have different indices of refraction, the air can indeed bend light away from the forward direction and create a shadow.

The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.

The index of refraction of air also changes as the pressure and composition changes, therefore these effects can also lead to air shadows. For instance, the pressure variations caused by a plane plowing through the air can cause shadows. Also, gases being vented into ambient air creates spatial variations in the air, and therefore shadow-causing variations in the index of refraction.";"The ability of non-uniform air to create shadows is used to great advantage in the imaging technique known as schlieren photography. In schlieren photography, the shadows are used to accurately map out the variations in the air, as shown below.

schleiren photograph of air casting shadows
In schlieren photography, the ability of air variations to cast shadows is used to study the interaction of air with objects. For instance, this schlieren image was used to study the airflow around the SLS rocket as it travels at high speed (as simulated in a wind tunnel).

Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2019;Jan Feb;"Can gold be created from other elements?
";Yes, gold can be created from other elements. But the process requires nuclear reactions, and is so expensive that you currently cannot make money by selling the gold that you create from other elements.;"All regular matter is made out of atoms. All atoms are made out of a small nucleus containing protons and neutrons bound together, and a large cloud of electrons bound to the nucleus. Since most of an atom's physical and chemical properties are determined by the number and shapes of its electrons, and since the number and shapes of its electrons are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus, the nature of an atom is largely determined by the number of protons in its nucleus. All atoms with the same number of protons in their nucleus behave almost identically. For this reason, we call a group of atoms with the same number of protons a ""chemical element"", and we associate various properties with particular elements.

Gold is the chemical element with 79 protons in each atomic nucleus. Every atom containing 79 protons is a gold atom, and all gold atoms behave the same chemically. In principle, we can therefore create gold by simply assembling 79 protons (and enough neutrons to make the nucleus stable). Or even better, we can remove one proton from mercury (which has 80) or add one proton to platinum (which has 78) in order to make gold. The process is simple in principle but hard to do in practice. Adding or removing protons from a nucleus are types of nuclear reactions. As such, no series of chemical reactions can ever create gold. Chemical reactions change the number and shape of the electrons in an atom but leave the nucleus of the atom unchanged. The ancient alchemist dream of creating gold by simply reacting chemicals is therefore impossible. You have to use nuclear reactions to create gold. The difficulty is that nuclear reactions require a lot of energy.

The nucleus of a stable atom is very tightly bound together, so it is hard to get anything permanently into or out of the nucleus. To induce a nuclear reaction, we have to shoot high-energy particles at a nucleus. We can get such particles either from radioactive decay, from nuclear reactions in a reactor, from the acceleration of slow particles, or from a mix of these techniques. For example, Sherr, Bainbridge, and Anderson created gold in 1941 by shooting neutrons at mercury. The neutrons were generated by a series of nuclear reactions that were kick-started by the Harvard cyclotron particle accelerator.

Usually gold is created from platinum, which has one less proton than gold, or from mercury, which has one more proton than gold. Bombarding a platinum or mercury nucleus with neutrons can knock off an neutron or add on a neutron, which through natural radioactive decay can lead to gold. As should be obvious by this production process, much of the gold created from other elements is radioactive. Radioactive gold is hazardous to humans and cannot be sold commercially. Furthermore, when radioactive gold undergoes radioactive decay after a few days, it is no longer gold. Therefore, in order to create non-radioactive gold that you can sell to consumers you have to:

Build a nuclear reactor to act as your source of neutrons.
Place mercury in the reactor. After a large amount of work, only a tiny portion of gold is created.
Decontaminate the resulting gold. This is harder than it sounds because you can't separate out non-radioactive gold from radioactive gold using purely chemical methods.";It should be obvious from this process that it currently costs much more money to create non-radioactive gold than you could ever earn by selling the gold. Creating gold from other elements is currently an expensive laboratory experiment and not a viable commercial activity. Perhaps technology will improve enough in the future to make creation of gold in nuclear reactors a profitable economic enterprise.;buffalo,limited,push,sitting,determine
Cambridge;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2013;Aug Sep;"Can light bend around corners?
";"Yes, light can bend around corners. In fact, light always bends around corners to some extent. This is a basic property of light and all other waves. The amount of light that bends around a corner depends on the exact situation. For visible light on the human scale, the amount of light that bends around corners is often too small to notice unless you know how to look for it. The ability of light to bend around corners is also known as ""diffraction"". There are two mechanisms that cause light to bend around corners.";"1. Internal Diffraction.
Light is a lot more complex than many people realize. The ray picture of light, which describes light as a bunch of arrows traveling in straight lines and bouncing off objects, is an understandable and even useful picture, but it is greatly over-simplified. In reality, light is a quantized waving of the electromagnetic field. Light is always waving against itself, leading to internal interference of the different wave components in what we call internal diffraction. This diffraction causes a beam of light to slowly spread out as it travels, so that some of the light bends away from the straight line motion of the main part of the wave. Even seemingly perfect laser beams spread out as they travel because of internal diffraction. This turning away of some of the light from the forward direction is a form of ""bending around corners"" even when a corner may not exist. The tendency of beams to spread out via diffraction makes it so that a light beam can never be focused to a perfect point, and, in consequence, light microscopes cannot perform infinite magnification. Many textbooks imply that all diffraction is caused by light interacting with an object. This is not strictly true. A finite beam of light traveling through free space where no objects are present will still spread out because of internal diffraction. Other names for simple internal diffraction are ""beam spreading"" or ""beam divergence"". Note that when a system involves creating multiple beams, diffraction can lead to beautiful patterns of rings or stars, but the basic mechanism is still the same: light interferes with itself.

In general, a light beam spreads out more (turns the corner more) if the beam has a narrow beam width compared to its wavelength. Light can therefore be made to spread out more by reducing the beam width or by increasing the wavelength of the light. The wavelength of visible light is so small that you have to use very narrow beams of visible light in order to notice its diffraction. Such narrow beams are typically obtained by running light through a very narrow slit. For large-wavelength light such as radio waves, the bending of the wave around human-scale objects is much stronger. Note that the light from a flashlight spreads out not because of diffraction. It spreads out because the mirror in a flashlight is specifically designed to bounce light in different directions. Also, note that the fuzziness of shadows in everyday life is not caused by diffraction, but is instead caused by the fact that an extended light source creates many, slightly-offset, shadows of the object which blur together.

2. Interaction with Objects
Light can also interact with objects in such a way that its ability to bend around corners is enhanced. Light passing through a simple slit and diffracting could be described as light interacting with an object, but such a situation is more a case of internal diffraction. The slit simply creates a narrow beam and then does nothing more, so that the diffraction in such a case results internally from a narrow beam interfering with itself. In contrast, there are cases where the interaction of light with an object does more to the light than just change its beam width. If light hits an object made out of conducting material (such as metal), the electromagnetic fields in the light exert a force on and accelerate the free charges in the conductor, thereby inducing electric currents in the surface of the conducting object. These oscillating electric currents create more light, and this light induces more currents. The end result is that part of the light that hits an electrically conductive material couples to the surface of the object and travels as a surface wave. Light can therefore bend around the corner of an object by riding the curved surface of the object.";"For a smooth surface, the light can travel along the surface for a relatively long distance. However, roughness, irregularities, cracks, bumps, and seams on the object's surface interrupt the coupling between light and the electric currents in the surface, so that the surface waves tends to scatter off into space at such obstacles instead of continuing to ride the surface. In optics, light waves riding the surface of a conductive object are called ""surface plasmons"". In radar, such waves are called ""creeping waves"" or simply ""surface waves"". In radar images, this creeping wave effect can lead to physically important ghost images or echo images of the object, because it takes longer for the creeping wave to return to the receiver than the main reflected wave.";ice,region,riding,iron,using
Cambridge;AS;2210 - Computer Science;2020;Jan Feb;"Can momentum be hidden to human eyes like how kinetic energy can be hidden as heat?
";"Yes and no. In a regular mechanical system with macroscopic parts, momentum can not be ""hidden"" to human eyes. But in other systems, momentum can be hidden. For instance, in an electromagnetic system, momentum can be transferred to the electromagnetic field, which is invisible to human eyes at most frequencies. Therefore, momentum can be ""hidden"" in the electromagnetic field. Let us explore this topic more in depth.";"Every isolated system obeys the law of conservation of energy which states that if no energy is externally extracted or inserted into the system, its total energy will remain constant in time. For example, consider two hockey pucks sliding towards each other on ice. If you sum the kinetic (motional) energy of both pucks before they collide, you will find that it equals the sum of both energies after they collide. We can in fact use the conservation of energy along with some other information to predict what will happen in a simple collision like this.

But now suppose we fire the two pucks directly at each other at the same speed and cover their sides with perfect glue. What happens? Of course, when the pucks make contact, they stick together and both end up with zero speed, and therefore zero kinetic energy. This means that the total kinetic energy of the two-puck system at the beginning was some big number, but the total kinetic energy at the end was zero (at least according to human eyes). Has the glue broken the law of conservation of energy? No. If you did a careful analysis of this event, and measured everything you could think of, you would find that the heat (thermal energy) in the two pucks increases after the collision by the exact same amount as the kinetic energy that seemed to disappear (neglecting the friction of the ice). The macroscopic kinetic energy has therefore been converted into heat. The law of conservation of energy still holds as long as we add heat as one of the things that contributes to the total energy. Such a collision is called an inelastic collision.

But what is heat? On the atomic level, we find that hotter substances have their atoms vibrating faster and moving around at higher speeds. Thermal energy is therefore just the kinetic energy of microscopic, randomly-moving particles. When the two pucks with glue stick together, their kinetic energy is not really converted to some mysterious thing called ""heat"". Their macroscopic, ordered kinetic energy (ordered in the sense that all the atoms in the puck are moving along with the puck as it zips across the ice) is simply converted to microscopic, random kinetic energy. The atoms at the surface of each puck smash together, get displaced, smash into other atoms, and so on, creating vibrations. Macroscopic, ordered kinetic energy is obvious to the human eye (we see the puck moving), but microscopic, random kinetic energy is invisible to the human eye (we cannot directly see the atoms jiggling). In this sense, an inelastic collision causes some of the kinetic energy to be ""hidden"" from human eyes in the form of heat. If we include only the forms of energy visible to the human eye, glue seems to defeat the law of conservation of energy. But if we include hidden kinetic energy (heat), the law still holds.

Now there is another law called the law of conservation of momentum. It states that the total momentum of an isolated system before an event must be equal to the total momentum of the system after the event. What is the difference between this law and the law of conservation of energy. The difference is that energy is just a number, while momentum has a direction. Conservation of momentum therefore tells us things like: two pucks initially traveling to the right that collide (say, because one is going faster and overtakes the other) must still be traveling to the right after the collision. The total momentum of both pucks is to the right in the beginning, so it must be to the right in the end. The law of conservation of energy cannot tell us this because it says nothing about directions. Or similarly, if one puck traveling east approaches another puck traveling north, the total momentum is in the north-east direction. Conservation of momentum tells us that after the collision, the total momentum must still be in the north-east direction.

Since momentum obeys a conservation law just like energy, and since kinetic energy can be hidden from human eyes in the form of microscopic motion, it is natural to wonder whether momentum can also be hidden. Does the two-puck-glue system convert momentum to some hidden form upon collision, and therefore some momentum seems to get ""lost"" to human eyes? No. The reason the answer is no is because momentum is directional. The atoms do indeed jiggle faster after an inelastic collision, but the total momentum of atoms jiggling in place is always zero. Put simply, when the atomic motion is random, for every atom going left there is another atom going right, so that their directionality adds to zero. Since momentum describes the directionality of motion, the momentum for simple thermal motion is zero. In order for momentum to not be zero, the atoms have to all be traveling more or less in the same direction. But when all the atoms are traveling in the same direction, the macroscopic object itself is traveling somewhere, which is quite visible to the human eye. Because momentum is directional, it cannot be hidden from the human eye in the form of random atomic motion. Therefore, even if we cover the sides of the pucks with glue so that they stick, the total visible momentum before will equal the total visible momentum after. This makes sense because if the two pucks are flying at each other at the same speed from opposite directions (and have the same mass), their total momentum before is zero (east plus the same amount of west equals zero), so their total momentum after sticking together is zero (zero plus zero equals zero).

This idea extends beyond pucks colliding. Any macroscopic mechanical system cannot hide momentum. But, if the system has parts that are so small that they are invisible to the naked eye, and these parts can undergo ordered motion, momentum can be transferred and hidden in these parts. For instance, if a tennis ball is covered with dust grains that are so small you can't see them, when the tennis ball gets hit, the dust can fly off to one side and carry away some of the momentum. If we don't notice the dust, and don't include it in our calculations, we would find that some of the total momentum becomes hidden after the collision.

Richard Feynman states in his book, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, the following:

""Are there also hidden forms of momentum-perhaps heat momentum?"" The answer is that it is very hard to hide momentum for the following reasons. The random motions of the atoms of a body furnish a measure of heat energy, if the squares of the velocities are summed. This sum will be a positive result, having no directional character. The heat is there, whether or not the body moves as a whole, and conservation of energy in the form of heat is not very obvious. On the other hand, if one sums the velocities, which have direction, and finds a result that is not zero, that means that there is a drift of the entire body in some particular direction, and such a gross momentum is readily observed. Thus there is no random internal lost momentum, because the body has net momentum only when it moves as a whole. Therefore momentum, as a mechanical quantity, is difficult to hide. Nevertheless, momentum can be hidden-in the electromagnetic field, for example.

";"Let us move beyond mechanical systems. Electromagnetic waves such as light or radio waves carry momentum. Since all electromagnetic waves are invisible to humans except the narrow range of colors from red to violet, momentum can be hidden in the electromagnetic field. In practice, the momentum carried by electromagnetic waves is so small that you have to use very sensitive instruments to measure it, but in principle it is always there. For instance, if you turn on a radar gun, radio waves come out the front of the gun, carrying momentum with them. Because of momentum conservation, the radar gun itself must therefore recoil in the opposite direction when it is turned on. This recoil is typically too small to notice. But for the sake of the argument, suppose we have a giant radar gun that emits a large amount of radio waves. Since radio waves are invisible to the human eye, all that we would see would be the gun jump backwards upon being turned on, clearly violating conservation of momentum (if we only include visible momentum). We would therefore conclude (and rightly so), that there must be momentum hidden somewhere. In this way, momentum can be ""hidden"" in the electromagnetic field. Although, it is really only hidden to human eyes. We can detect radio waves just fine with an antenna.";salt,tightly,freedom,liquid,crowd
Edexcel;AS;2281 - Economics,;2004;May Jun;"Can one bit of light bounce off another bit of light?
";Yes, one bit of light can bounce off another bit of light, but not directly, and the effect is very rare. Light is made out of small quantum objects called photons. When you turn on a lamp, the light bulb begins creating and emitting trillions upon trillions of photons. Photons are in a class of quantum particles known as bosons.;"Bosons are special because many bosons can occupy the exact same quantum state at the same time. Light being made of bosons is what makes a laser beam possible. A laser beam is a collection of many photons all in the same quantum state. In contrast, particles that are not bosons cannot occupy the same state at the same time. This is one of the effects that keeps the atoms in an object from collapsing to a single point. The principle that dictates that non-bosons cannot be in the same state is called the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Non-bosons are also called fermions. The fact that bosons such as light can occupy the same state means that they don't get in each other's way.

Also, light dominantly interacts with objects that have electric charge. Since light itself does not have electric charge, one photon cannot directly interact with another photon. Instead, they just pass right through each other without being affected. Because they are bosons and because they carry no electric charge, one photon cannot directly bounce off another photon. If you point one jet of water towards another jet of water, then at the point where they cross you will get a mess of water spraying all over due to the collisions. In contrast, if you shine one light beam such that it crosses another light beam, they will just pass through each other unaffected.

However, two photons heading towards each other can indeed collide indirectly. The process goes like this. A photon can spontaneously degenerate into a particle with mass and its antiparticle in a process known as pair production. In this process, the energy of the photon is completely transformed into the mass of the two particles. For example, a photon can turn into an electron and an anti-electron. If two photons head towards each other and they both turn into electron/anti-electron pairs at about the same time, then these particles can interact. The anti-electron from one photon will collide with an electron from the other photon, and turn back to light. The same thing happens to the other anti-electron and electron. The overall effect is that you get two photons going into the interaction and you get two photons coming out of the interaction, so it looks like the photons simply bounced off each other. In a sense, the one bit of light did indeed bounce off the other bit of light, but only indirectly by transforming into other particles.

This interaction is shown in the diagram. The red squiggles represent photons, the e+ blue lines are anti-electrons (positrons), and the e- blue lines are electrons. A photon comes from the left of the diagram and decays into an electron and an anti-electron. At the same time, another photon comes from the right and turns into an electron and an anti-electron. Each anti-electron collides with an electron, they mutually annihilate and turn back into a new photon.";Photon-photon scattering is therefore possible through an indirect mechanism, but it is rare. There are two reasons that it is rare. First, light can only turn into other particles if it has enough energy to create the mass needed for the new particles, according to E = mc2. Because c is such a huge number, it takes a large amount of energy to make a little bit of mass. In order to turn into an electron and an anti-electron, the photon must have at least as much energy as the equivalent energy of their combined masses. Only gamma rays (one step higher than X-rays) have enough energy to do this. Secondly, the photons have to transform at just the right moment in order for the new particles from both photons to collide. For both of these reasons, light-light scattering is very rare. In fact, light-light scattering has never been conclusively observed. All the steps in light-light scattering have been observed (pair production and pair annihilation), so that we know that it is possible. The whole effect is just so rare that it has never been observed. However, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has both the ability to create high-energy light, and the ability to create a lot of it, making the rarity of light-light scattering more manageable. It is only a matter of time before the LHC observes light bouncing off light.;nearer,large,whistle,pay,giving
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2002;Jan Feb;"Can radio antennas emit visible light?
";Yes, radio antennas can emit visible light, but probably not in the way that you're thinking. If you pump enough energy into a radio antenna, you can heat it up until it glows and emits visible light through the process of thermal radiation. However, a regular radio antenna cannot emit visible light that carries information, similar to how it does with radio waves. There are, however, other devices that can do this.;"As you may have learned, electromagnetic waves come in many different frequencies, from radio, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet to x-rays and gamma rays. The red light emitted by a glow stick is fundamentally the same as the radio wave emitted by your Wi-Fi router. Both are electromagnetic waves. The red light just has a much higher frequency than the radio wave (the frequency is a measure of how many cycles the wave completes every second). Because they are fundamentally the same, you could be tempted to conclude that you can get a radio antenna to emit controlled visible light by simply cranking up the frequency of the circuit that is driving the antenna. While this makes sense at first glance, the reality of the material properties of antennas gets in the way. A radio antenna works by using electric circuits to push electrons up and down the antenna, causing the electric fields of the electrons to wave up and down as well. These oscillating electric fields then travel away as electromagnetic radio waves. The frequency of the radio wave is equal to the frequency at which you push the electrons up and down the antenna.

A typical Wi-Fi router radio antenna emits radio waves that have a frequency of 2.4 GHz (2.4 billion cycles per second), which corresponds to a wavelength of 12.5 centimeters. In general, a radio antenna emits waves most efficiently when its length is equal to the wavelength of the radio wave, or to a half or a quarter of the wavelength. It therefore should not be surprising that the antennas on your Wi-Fi router are about 12.5 centimeters long. In contrast, the wavelength of blue light is about 470 nanometers. To give you an idea, this is a hundred times smaller than the smallest cell in your body. Blue light has a wavelength that is about 300,000 times smaller than that of a Wi-Fi radio wave. A normal-sized radio antenna is simply too large to efficiently emit visible light because of this size mismatch, even if we managed to overcome the material problems. You may think we could just chop down the size of the antenna to match the wavelength of visible light, but such an antenna would have to be only 1000 atoms long. Making such a small antenna is difficult, but not impossible. The emerging field of plasmonic nanoantennas accomplishes this very task, as I will discuss at the end of this article. Even if you successfully make such a small antenna, you still need to build an electronic circuit that can drive the electrons up and down the antenna at the right frequency. The frequency of blue light is about 640 THz (640 trillion cycles per second). Electronic circuits can only drive electric currents that oscillate at best in the hundreds of GHz (hundreds of billions of cycles per second). If you try to go higher, the electronic circuits stop working because the material properties of the circuit components change.

Even if you managed to make a radio antenna that is small enough to match the wavelength of blue light and managed to create a device that can drive electrons at the frequency of blue light, there is still one major problem that gets in the way: the atomic structure of the antenna material. For large-wavelength electron oscillations, the antenna material looks uniform and lacks significant resistance. In contrast, for nanoscale oscillations, the electrons are more likely to bump into atoms and lose their energy to the atoms before they have a chance to emit their energy as light. The ordered motion of the electrons is quickly transferred to a disordered motion of the atoms. Macroscopically, we say that when the frequency is too high, most of the electrical energy is converted to waste heat before it has a chance to be emitted as light.

The three main obstacles are therefore: the small size needed for the antenna, the difficulty in finding a way to drive the electrons at high frequency, and the tendency of high-frequency electrons to lose their energy to heat. These obstacles can be overcome to some extent using three different approaches: (1) lock the electrons down in small, localized atomic/molecular states where they can't bump into atoms as much and then drive the electron oscillations using the fact that they naturally oscillate when they transition between states, (2) shoot the electrons through a vacuum at high speed past magnets, and (3) build nanoscale, precisely shaped antennas and drive the electron oscillations using incident light.

The first method is exactly how a traditional laser works. Materials are chosen where certain electrons are locked into useful states. The electrons are excited to new states and then stimulated to fall back to their original states. Rather than oscillate back and forth between two points in space, the electrons in a traditional laser oscillate back and forth between two atomic/molecular states. This different kind of wiggling allows the frequency of oscillation to be high and helps prevent the electrons from bumping into atoms, thereby losing their energy to heat. The problem of electrons colliding with atoms is still a problem in lasers (scientists call this effect ""phonon emission""), but it's not an insurmountable obstacle. Because lasers are controlled sources of visible light, they can be used to send information similar to how radio waves carry information. In fact, fiber optic cables contain information-carrying light beams that were created by lasers (although, most optical fibers use infrared light rather than visible light for efficiency reasons). Lasers can also be used to send information-carrying visible light through free space. This set-up is called optical wireless communication.

The second method is how a free electron laser works. In this case, electrons are shot through a vacuum at very high speed and then a series of magnets are applied to get the electrons to wiggle back and forth at high frequency, thereby emitting visible light. A free electron laser that is designed to force the electrons to wiggle at 640 THz will indeed emit blue light in a controlled way. Since free electron lasers need vacuum chambers and high-power electron accelerators to function, free electron lasers are used mostly in the laboratory setting.

The third method is how plasmonic nanoantennas work. Out of all of the devices that emit visible light in a controlled way, plasmonic nanoantennas are the closest to traditional radio antennas. A plasmonic nanoatenna is a nanoscale, precisely shaped metal antenna that has plasma resonances excited in it (bunched-up electron oscillations). Since plasmonic nanoantennas rely on electrons that slosh back and forth between one point in space and another just like traditional radio antennas, thermal loss is still a major problem when they operate at visible light frequencies. For this reason, optical plasmonic nanoantennas are still laboratory oddities and are not practical sources of controlled visible light. Since lasers are becoming increasingly cheap, small, and reliable, there isn't really a motivation to develop plasmonic nanoantennas to emit information-carrying visible light. Furthermore, since electronic circuits can't run at optical frequencies, plasmonic nanoantennas can't be excited by hooking them up to an electronic circuit. They have to be excited by being hit with incident light. In this way, plasmonic nanoantennas aren't like traditional antennas at all. They are more like scattering objects.";"Note that there are many other ways to create visible light; fires, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, gas discharge tubes, chemical reactions; but none of these ways create visible light in a controlled way (i.e. coherent visible light) such that a lot of information can be carried on the light waves, similar to as is done with radio waves.

In summary, if you want a radio antenna to emit visible light, just heat it up. If you want a traditional antenna to emit visible light in a controlled way such that you can transmit information, you are out of luck. Fortunately, there are other devices that can transmit information using visible light, the most practical of which is the laser.";crowd,standard,blue,push,subject
Cambridge;A;1123 - English Language;2007;Jan Feb;"Can sound waves generate heat?
";Yes, sound waves can generate heat. In fact, sound waves almost always generate a little bit of heat as they travel and almost always end up as heat when they are absorbed. Sound and heat are both macroscopic descriptions of the movement of atoms and molecules. Sound is the ordered movement of atoms and molecules in rapid waving patterns.;"Heat is the disordered, random, movement of atoms and molecules. Therefore, all you have to do in order to turn sound into heat is transform some of the ordered movement of the atoms and molecules into disordered movement. This effect always happens to some extent. This effect happens a lot whenever the sound wave encounters irregularities as it travels.

For instance, dust particles in air are irregularities that randomly interfere with the vibrating motion of some of the air molecules that make up the sound wave. The dust particles mess up some of the ordered motion, and therefore convert some of the sound to heat. As another example, the rough surface of an object constitutes a collection of irregularities that the sound wave encounters. Therefore, when a sound wave hits a rough surface, the motion of the air molecules gets scrambled up a bit. Note that the air molecules already have a motion that is somewhat disordered. In other words, air through which sound is traveling already contains some amount of heat. When some of the sound wave is converted to heat, the motion of the air molecules becomes more disordered and the amount of heat increases.

The ordered movement of atoms is also made more disorderly when sound travels through acoustically absorbent materials. Materials can be made absorbent by embedding an array of little irregularities directly into the material, such as air bubbles. For this reason, materials that are soft and porous, like cloth, are good at converting sound to heat. The sound is said to be ""absorbed"" or ""lost"" when it is converted to heat inside a material. Even without irregularities, a material can be highly absorbent if the atoms and molecules that make up the material cannot slide past each other smoothly. In this case, an atom or molecule that is trying to participate in the ordered vibrational motion of the sound wave roughly slides past the neighboring atoms or molecules that are off to the side, such that motion gets diverted in sideways directions rather than continuing in the forward direction as part of the sound wave. The ordered motion therefore becomes disordered. You can think of it as a kind of internal friction that all materials posses to some extent. In this way, some of the sound energy is converted to thermal energy. All materials, even air, have some amount of resistance to smooth atomic/molecular sliding and therefore are somewhat absorbent to sound.";In summary, sound waves always generate a little heat as they travel and they ultimately almost always end up completely as heat when they are absorbed by materials. However, the amount of energy carried by sound waves is very small, so that the amount of heat they generate is typically insignificant. In short, cranking up the volume on your speakers is a terrible way to try to heat up your room. Yelling at your soup does indeed warm it up, but the amount is far too small to be noticeable.;stairs,add,browserling,basis,behavior
Cambridge;AS;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2006;May Jun;"Can the decay half-life of a radioactive material be changed?
";Yes, the decay half-life of a radioactive material can be changed. Radioactive decay happens when an unstable atomic nucleus spontaneously changes to a lower-energy state and spits out a bit of radiation. This process changes the atom to a different element or a different isotope. Since radioactive decay is a spontaneous event, you may think that the half-life of the decay process is completely fixed and cannot be altered by outside influences. However, this statement is not completely true.;"First of all, it is worth pointing out that the time when an individual radioactive atom decays is completely random. It is impossible to predict when an individual radioactive atom will decay. The half-life of a certain type of atom does not describe the exact amount of time that every single atom experiences before decaying. Rather, the half-life describes the average amount of time it takes for a large group of amounts to reach the point where half of the atoms have decayed.

The half-life of a radioactive material can be changed using time dilation effects. According to relativity, time itself can be slowed down. Everything that experiences time can therefore be given a longer effective lifetime if time is dilated. This can be done in two ways. Traveling at a speed close to the speed of light causes time to slow down significantly, relative to the stationary observer. For instance, a number of radioactive atoms shot through a tube at high speed in the lab will have their half-life lengthened relative to the lab because of time dilation. This effect has been verified many times using particle accelerators. Time can also be dilated by applying a very strong gravitational field. For instance, placing a bunch of radioactive atoms near a black hole will also extend their half-life relative to the distant observer because of time dilation.

The half-life of radioactive decay can also be altered by changing the state of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. In a type of radioactive decay called ""electron capture"", the nucleus absorbs one of the atom's electrons and combines it with a proton to make a neutron and a neutrino. The more the wavefunctions of the atom's electrons overlap with the nucleus, the more able the nucleus is to capture an electron. Therefore, the half-life of an electron-capture radioactive decay mode depends slightly on what state the atom's electrons are in. By exciting or deforming the atom's electrons into states that overlap less with the nucleus, the half-life can be reduced. Since the chemical bonding between atoms involves the deformation of atomic electron wavefunctions, the radioactive half-life of an atom can depend on how it is bonded to other atoms. Simply by changing the neighboring atoms that are bonded to a radioactive isotope, we can change its half-life. However, the change in half-life accomplished in this way is typically small. For instance, a study performed by B. Wang et al and published in the European Physical Journal A was able to measure that the electron capture half-life of beryllium-7 was made 0.9% longer by surrounding the beryllium atoms with palladium atoms.

In addition to altering the chemical bonds, the half-life can be altered by simply removing electrons from the atom. In the extreme limit of this approach, all of the electrons can be ripped off of a radioactive atom. For such an ion, there are no longer any electrons available to capture, and therefore the half-life of the electron capture radioactive decay mode becomes infinite. Certain radioactive isotopes that can only decay via the electron capture mode (such as rubidium-83) can be made to never decay by ripping off all the electrons. Other types of radioactive decay besides electron capture have also been found to have the decay half-life depend on the state of the surrounding electrons, but the effects are smaller. The change in half-life due to changing the electron environment is generally very small, typically much less than 1%.

Lastly, the half-life of a radioactive material can be changed by bombarding it with high-energy radiation. This should not come as a surprise since radioactive decay is a nuclear reaction, and inducing other nuclear reactions at the same time as the decay can interfere with it. However, at this point, you don't really have stand-alone radioactive decay. Rather, you have nuclear reaction soup, so this approach may not really count as ""changing the half-life"".";When reference books list values for the half-life of various materials, they are really listing the half-life for the material when its atoms are at rest, in the ground state, and in a particular chemical bonding configuration. Note that most changes to the half-life of radioactive materials are very small. Furthermore, large changes to a half-life require elaborate, expensive, high-energy equipment (e.g. particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, ion traps). Therefore, outside of specialized labs, we can say that as a good approximation radioactive decay half-lives don't change. For instance, carbon dating and geological radiometric dating are so accurate because decay half-lives in nature are so close to constant.;bell,bend,sick,stairs,flat
Edexcel;O;4024 - Mathematics D;2011;Aug Sep;"Can you go fast enough to get enough mass to become a black hole?
";Traveling at high speed does not affect your mass, even in Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. For some reason, pre-college teachers, popular science books, and older physics textbooks claim that objects gain mass when they are traveling at higher speeds. This claim is wrong.;"If you define something called ""relativistic mass"" that is completely different from regular mass, then this claim could be made to look true. But doing so is very confusing and misleading. Today's physicists no longer treat the motion energy of an object as ""relativistic mass"" because doing so is misleading. When an object gains speeds, the entity that it gains is called ""kinetic energy"", even in Special Relativity. The total energy of a moving object is therefore its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The rest energy of an object is contained in its mass. The relativistic total energy of a moving object is:

E = mc2/(1-v2/c2)1/2

In this equation, m is the mass of the object (which does not change no matter how fast the object is moving), c is the speed of light, and v is the speed of the object. If the object is not moving, v = 0, then there is no kinetic energy and the total energy just equals the rest energy. Plugging v = 0 into the equation above, we end up with the famous equation E = mc2. The rest energy of an object is therefore mc2, telling us that the rest energy is contained completely in the form of mass. The kinetic energy EK is therefore the total energy minus the rest energy:

EK = E â€“ mc2

EK = mc2(1/(1-v2/c2)1/2 â€“ 1)

This equation shows us that as the speed increases, the kinetic energy increases, but the mass never changes. In the limit that the speed of the object v approaches the speed of light in vacuum c, the kinetic energy becomes infinite. The law of conservation of energy tells us that to get an object traveling with infinite kinetic energy, we have to give it infinite energy. This act is clearly impossible as there is only a finite amount of energy in the observable universe. This facts means that objects with mass can never travel exactly at the speed of light in vacuum, as that state would require infinite energy. But objects can get very close to the speed of light.

Mass is the property of an object that describes two things:

The object's resistance to acceleration. Larger masses accelerate less when a given force is applied.
The object's ability to experience gravity. Larger masses feel larger forces in a given gravitational field.";When an object is traveling at a high speed, its resistance to acceleration does not change and its ability to experience gravity does not change. The mass of an object therefore does not change when it travels at high speed. This fact is predicted by Einstein's theories and verified by experiment. An object can never be turned into a black hole, or even be made slightly overweight by speeding it up.;silly,teach,congress,failed,regular
Edexcel;O;2281 - Economics,;2020;May Jun;"Can you make a shock wave of light by breaking the light barrier just like supersonic airplanes break the sound barrier?
";Yes and no. It depends on the material you are in. In order to keep things from traveling into the past, and thereby preserve local conservation of mass-energy, and thereby prohibit the universe from exploding in an instant, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum. Supersonic airplanes break the sound barrier by flying faster than the speed of sound. This is possible because sound is just a traveling vibration of air molecules. As airplanes approach the speed of sound, their sound waves pile up into a wall of air pressure that shatters apart weak airplanes.;"Airplanes that are strong enough can poke through this wall of air pressure and create a shock wave that trails behind them. When this sonic shock wave passes ground observers, we hear it as a sonic boom. By analogy, if a space ship traveled faster than the speed of light, it would create a shock wave made entirely of light. The problem is that nothing can go faster than the speed of light in vacuum, so a space ship can never go fast enough to break the light barrier. It's not a question of engineering, but of fundamental physics. As an object approaches the speed of light, it takes an increasing amount of energy to accelerate. It would take literally an infinite amount of energy for a space ship to exactly reach the speed of light in vacuum. This fact is verified every day in particle accelerators. Using the electrical power consumption of a small town, particle accelerators channel that energy into getting a handful of tiny particles like protons and electrons traveling very close to the speed of light in vacuum. Every year, particle accelerators are being improved to reach ever higher speeds. For instance, one decade the record was that the particles were traveling at 99.99% the speed of light in vacuum, and then the next decade an improved machine reached 99.999% the speed of light in vacuum, and the following decade saw a record of 99.9999% (these numbers are for illustration purposes only and are not exact). The current record is held by the LHC which has accelerated protons to 99.999997% the speed of light in vacuum. A ship in space can't ever reach the speed of light in vacuum, and therefore can't ever break the light barrier and create an optical shock wave.

Everything discussed so far applies only to vacuum. The situation gets interesting when you are not in vacuum. When traveling through a material such as water or glass, the speed of light in that material is significantly slower than the speed of light in vacuum. An object can go faster than the speed of light in a material without breaking any fundamental laws. And as you would expect, an object traveling through a material at a speed that is faster than the light in that material does indeed create an optical shock wave. This shock wave of light is known as Cherenkov radiation. In order for the effect to be noticeable to the naked eye, the object has to be traveling very quickly through a fairly dense material. For instance, nuclear reactors spit out electrons at very high speeds as by-products of the nuclear reaction. These high-speed electrons travel through the cooling water faster than the speed of light in the water, and therefore create shock waves of light. This Cerenkov radiation is observed as an eerie blue glow.";Even though air is very close to being a vacuum, it is not exactly a vacuum. The speed of light in air is slightly less than the speed of light in vacuum, so objects can actually break the light barrier in air without going faster than the fundamental limit of the speed of light in vacuum. It is just much harder to get Cherenkov radiation in air than in water because higher speeds are required. But it does happen. Supernovae shoot out particles at amazingly high speeds (but always less than the speed of light in vacuum). When these particles hit earth's atmosphere, they are known as cosmic rays. Some of these cosmic rays and their by-products are indeed fast enough to create optical shock waves as they travel through the air. Although the atmospheric Cherenkov radiation from cosmic rays is too faint to see with the naked eye, it is detected by cameras and serves as an important tool for scientists studying cosmic rays.;soon,try,properly,happily,season

When light scatters off of an object that is much larger than its wavelength, the light acts just like a little marble. Because of this, the different colors of light all bounce off a large object at the same angle. This type of scattering is called ""geometric scattering"". It is the type of scattering that we are most familiar with in everyday life. Red light has a wavelength of 630 nanometers. In contrast, the diameter of an apple is about 8 centimeters, which is about 130,000 times larger than the wavelength of red light. Therefore, red light definitely bounces off an apple geometrically.

Since white light consists of all visible colors, shining white light on an object that is much bigger than the wavelength of the light causes the different colors to all reflect at the same angle. This leads to two effects when a big object is illuminated by white light: 1) the object has the same color no matter what angle it is viewed at, and 2) the overall color of the object is largely determined by which colors are and are not absorbed. For instance, a maple leaf is much larger than the wavelength of visible light and thus causes light to scatter geometrically. A healthy maple leaf absorbs red, orange, yellow, blue, and violet light from the full spread of colors that are present in the incident white sunlight. Therefore, the leaf only reflects back green light. We see the leaf as green since this is the only color of light that reaches our eyes. Furthermore, the leaf looks green from all viewing angles. Since the color of a large object is mostly determined by its absorption spectrum, which is typically constant for all objects made out of the same material, the color of a large object is the same for all objects in the same class. For instance, all the healthy leaves on an oak tree are green. Because color is constant across all viewing angles and across all objects in a class when optical scattering is at work, humans tend to think of color as an innate property of an object, which is a helpful but inaccurate oversimplification.

In contrast to geometric scattering, Rayleigh scattering involves the scattering of light off of objects that are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. When light scatters off of such an object, the light does not act like a marble striking and bouncing off a point on the surface of the object. Rather, the light acts like a vibrating uniform electric field that completely encompasses the object. As a result, the light scatters in all directions to some extent. Furthermore, the amount of light that scatters in a certain direction depends on the color of the light and not on the object's surface geometry. This leads to two effects when a small object (smaller than about 100 nanometers) is illuminated by white light: 1) the object has a different color depending on what angle it is viewed at, and 2) the color of the object is not determined by the shape or surface material properties of the object.

What is the pattern of color generated by Rayleigh scattering? An object displaying Rayleigh scattering scatters mostly blue and violet colors in the sideways direction, leaving red, orange, yellow, green, and reduced amounts of blue and violet to continue traveling in the forward direction.

Since small objects don't scatter very much light, and since humans can't see small amounts of light, it takes a large collection of small objects in order for humans to see the light produced by Rayleigh scattering. Furthermore, the objects have to be fairly spread out so that they act like independent objects. If a collection of small objects are closer to each other than the wavelength of light, they will just act like one giant object. So, where can we find a large collection of nanoscale objects that are somewhat dispersed? In the atmosphere and suspended in liquids.

When you think of small objects dispersed through the atmosphere, you probably think of dust particles, bits of pollution, raindrops, droplets of mist, and the small droplets of liquid water that make up clouds. It turns out that compared to the wavelength of visible light, all of these objects are far too big to participate in Rayleigh scattering. Instead, these objects mostly generate geometric scattering, which tends to scatter all colors equally in all directions. For this reason, dust, pollution, rain, mist, and clouds tend to be white, or variations of white such as gray or brown. The objects in the sky that are small enough to display Rayleigh scattering are the air molecules themselves, which are mostly nitrogen molecules (N2) and oxygen molecules (O2). Each air molecule scatters blue and violet colors the most in the sideways directions and lets the other colors continue on in the forward direction. That is why the daytime sky is blue (the daytime sky does not look violet for several reasons, the main one being that human eyes do not see the color violet very well). Around sunset, there is so much air between the sun and the observer that the blue colors have already been scattered to other parts of the earth, leaving mostly the red and orange colors.

Milk is mostly a collection of tiny protein-coated blobs of oil suspended in water. These blobs are small enough to generate Rayleigh scattering. Therefore, by shining light through a glass of milk, you can get the same color effects as in the sky. However, regular milk has such a high concentration of these oil blobs that each light ray scatters many times before exiting the cup. Each series of multiple scattering events tends to randomize and average away the color effects of Rayleigh scattering. As a result, a cup of milk at regular concentration just looks white. In order to see the color effects, you need to dilute the milk. This will cause the oil blobs to spread out enough that the light rays only scatter once.";Take a clear glass cup with a smooth surface and fill it almost to the top with water. Next, add milk to the cup one drop at a time. After adding each drop, mix everything together and look at a bright light bulb through the cup. Keep adding the drops of milk until the light bulb appears red or orange when viewed through the cup. Presto! You have a sunset in a cup. To heighten the effect, do this at night with all the lights turned off except the one light bulb you are looking at through the cup. Next, position yourself so that you are looking at the side of the cup relative to the line connecting the cup and the light bulb. You now see a blue color. Presto! You have the daytime sky in a cup.;moving,care,examine,sister,silly
Cambridge;O;5070 - Chemistry;2003;Aug Sep;"Could electronic devices charge themselves without being plugged into an electricity source?
";Yes, electronic devices can charge their batteries through various methods without being plugged into a source of electricity. What all the different methods have in common is that they absorb energy that is in some other form (heat, light, vibrations, radio waves, etc.) from the external environment and then convert the energy into electrochemical energy that is stored in the device's batteries. While such methods are scientifically sound and have already been successfully demonstrated, the energy captured from the outside environment is often not enough to be practically useful. Intense research is currently underway to make energy capture more efficient, and breakthroughs are beginning to be achieved in this area. Many phones are already available that offer wireless charging. Let us look at the main types of energy a device can use to charge itself without being plugged in.;"Solar Energy
The oldest energy capture method used on electronic devices is most likely solar energy capture using a solar cell. Small calculators that use solar cells to help power them have been around for decades. Solar cells (photovoltaics) absorb ordinary light and convert it directly to electricity using layers of semiconductors. While photovoltaics are well understood and commercially established at this point, there are several drawbacks in using photovoltaics to recharge a handheld electronic device. The main drawback is that the light-to-electricity conversion process of photovoltaics is inefficient. Recent advances have however been made that boost the efficiency, and intense research is ongoing to continue to increase the efficiency. The other drawback is that for typical lighting levels, light does not contain that much energy to begin with. For traditional solar cells to provide reasonable output power, they have to be large in size, out in the direct sunlight for a long time, and oriented towards the sun. None of these conditions is very practical for a cell phone that you keep in your pocket or your hand most of the day.

Vibrational/Kinetic Energy
Whenever an object moves or vibrates, it contains kinetic energy. If the object's motion is stopped in the right way, this kinetic energy can be converted into electricity instead of into the usual waste heat. Hybrid cars use this concept to put electricity back into the batteries whenever you step on the brakes. The kinetic energy of the car moving forward gets converted into electrical energy using a generator on the wheels, instead of the energy ending up as waste heat in the brake pads. For a handheld device, the most significant kinetic energy it has access to is the regular bumps and jostles the device experiences as you walk around and carry the device in your pocket. Research is ongoing to make kinetic energy capture practical and efficient. For instance, Zhong Lin Wang and Jinhui Song demonstrated the conversion of vibrational energy to electrical energy using piezoelectric nanowire arrays. Piezoelectric crystals have the interesting property that when they are squeezed, they produce a small amount of electricity. Typically, the amount of energy captured through the piezoelectric effect is too small to power a device, but recent advances in nanoscale structures are boosting their efficiency.

Heat Energy
The ambient heat in the natural environment can be captured and converted to electricity. There are many ways to do this, but the basic concept is to funnel the random thermal motion of ions or electrons into a more ordered motion of charge, which constitutes an electrical current. This funneling is often accomplished by layering various materials with different thermal and electrical properties. For instance, the researchers Guoan Tai, Zihan Xu, and Jinsong Liu have recently demonstrated the conversion of heat to electricity using the ion layer that forms between silicon and a copper(II) chloride solution.

Radio Waves and Electromagnetic Induction
All electromagnetic waves carry energy. Typically, the radio waves surrounding us are strong enough to carry a signal (such as a cell phone signal), but too weak to provide significant power to a device. By using more intense radio waves, energy can be beamed wirelessly at significant power levels to a device. Nikola Tesla is famous for pioneering research in wireless power transmission in the 1890's. In such an approach, the ambient radio waves from the rocks, trees, stars, and so forth are not strong enough to provide power. Instead, a dedicated power transmitter is needed to create the intense radio waves, which could be considered a drawback. Furthermore, if a simple tabletop radio transmitter is used, the device to be charged would have to be in the same building as the transmitter in order to efficiently capture the electromagnetic energy. This may not be a severe limitation as wireless signal transmitters such as WIFI routers and cell phone towers are already becoming common enough to provide internet connectivity with few gaps. The wireless power transmission equipment could be built into the existing wireless signal transmission infrastructure.";Because wireless power transmitters just need to be connected to a power source and do not need to be connected to the internet, they could even be installed in automobiles, boats, and in remote areas. Note that there is a fundamental difference between radio waves and electromagnetic induction. Radio waves are self-propagating traveling waves in the electromagnetic field. In contrast, induction effects are more localized electromagnetic disturbances that do not wave, but still carry energy. From a technology standpoint, radio wave power transmission and induction power transmission are virtually the same thing. Radio wave/inductive charging methods are already being used on several commercial products, such as Google's Nexus 4 phone and Nokia's Lumia 920 phone.;aboard,song,toward,yard,large
Cambridge;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2005;May Jun;"Could scientists perfectly simulate the entire universe in a computer, down to the last atom?
";No. Even with an incredibly powerful computer, scientists could never perfectly simulate the entire universe in a computer. There are a few reasons for this.;"1. The universe is non-deterministic.
On the fundamental level, the universe obeys quantum theory. Quantum theory is probabilistic and non-deterministic. This means that if you know everything there is to know about a certain electron at the current moment, and then perfectly apply all the equations of quantum theory to the electron, you cannot exactly predict where the electron will be in one minute. You can only predict the probability of the electron being at various locations. The probability distribution may give you a general idea of where the one electron will end up, and can even tell you the average location of many electrons, but quantum theory cannot tell you the actual, exact location of the electron. The problem is not with quantum theory. The problem is with the electron itself. Quantum objects like electrons are not hard little balls or classical waves. They are more complicated beasts that are somewhat particle-like and somewhat wave-like at the same time. Furthermore, quantum objects innately contain uncertainty in their properties. Electrons fundamentally don't have exact locations. They have locations that exist only up to a degree of definiteness as a result of their inherent uncertainty, which depends on the state of the electron.

The bottom line is that it is fundamentally impossible to predict exactly what a quantum object will do, because such certainty regarding the object does not exist in the first place. Even if we have all the information that exists, we can only calculate what a quantum object is most likely to do. Such is the nature of the quantum world. And since the entire universe is simply a collection of quantum objects, the universe itself cannot be exactly simulated. If you loaded into a computer all that there is to know about the entire universe at the current moment, down to every atom and particle; and if you perfectly implemented all the laws of physics into the computer, including quantum theory with its uncertainty principle; and then pressed ""Go"", the simulation would give you a certain predicted state for the universe in a million years. If you reset the computer and ran the exact same simulation again, you would get a slightly different result for a million years in the future. You would even get a very slightly different result for two seconds into the future, because the reality of the quantum nature of the universe will have been accurately built into your computer simulation. The simulated universe for two seconds into the future will accurately describe some physically plausible universe, it will just no longer exactly describe our universe. The more time that passes in the simulation, the less the simulated universe will match our physical universe, even though all information and physical laws have been perfectly programmed into the computer. Innate quantum uncertainty makes this result inevitable.

Note that quantum uncertainty does not render all computer simulations meaningless. It just means that scientists have to be content with less-than-perfect predictions. The greater the number of non-coherent interacting quantum objects that there are in a system, the lower the system's quantum uncertainty becomes, and the closer the system gets to acting deterministically. A baseball contains trillions upon trillions of non-coherent atoms, and therefore is ridiculously close to being deterministic. This fact allows a baseball outfielder to accurately predict where a ball will land based on its initial trajectory. The quantum uncertainty for a baseball is so low that a batted ball seems to land right where you expect it to. But, fundamentally, you cannot correctly predict the landing location of the baseball to infinite accuracy. However, for the purposes of catching the ball, you don't need anywhere close to infinite accuracy. In a similar way, computer simulations of lasers, cells, and galaxies can give us answers that are extremely close to accurate, even if we can't fundamentally know or predict the exact location and momentum of every atom and particle in the system.

2. The universe is most likely infinite.
In principle, it is impossible to directly observe an infinite object in a finite amount of time. However, we can make the reasonable deduction that an object is infinite if we mathematically approach infinity using a limiting procedure. For instance, the electric field created by an electric point charge is deduced to extend out infinitely in all directions. This infinite-extent property of the electric field can't be directly observed by humans, but it can be deduced. If you measure the electric field of a point charge that is 1 meter away to be 1000 mN/C, and then when the charge is 10 meters away you measure the field to be 10 mN/C, and then at 100 meters away the field is 0.1 mN/C, and so forth; then you see that the field strength depends on distance r according to 1/r2. According to this dependence, for large and larger distances, the field strength of a point charge gets smaller and smaller, but it never goes exactly to zero. Therefore the electric field extends out to infinity.

In a similar way, even though we can't directly observe the universe to be spatially infinite, all of our scientific measurements and theories seem to indicate that the universe is indeed infinite. If that is true, then that is another reason that a computer can't perfectly simulate the entire universe. Simulating an infinite universe would require infinite computing memory space. Note that this argument only limits simulating the entire universe. We could, in principle, simulate a portion of the universe, insofar as quantum uncertainty allows.

3. The computer is part of the universe.
The computer that is going to simulate the universe is also part of the universe. Therefore, if the computer is going to perfectly simulate the entire universe, it must also simulate itself. Not only that, the computer must simulate itself running a perfect simulation of the universe. Which, if it is perfect, must also contain a simulation of the computer. Therefore, the simulation must contain the computer running a simulation of the entire universe, which must contain the computer running a simulation of the entire universe, which must... and so on forever. In the field of computer science, this process is known as ""infinite recursion"", and it leads to your computer freezing up and never making any progress in its calculations. Therefore a computer that is making a simulation of the universe in which the computer resides can never make an exact simulation of the entire universe.

You may say that the simulation can just simulate the entire universe minus the computer itself in order to avoid infinite recursion and still end up with the correct simulation. But this approach will not give you a correct simulation because everything in the universe has the potential to interact with everything else. For instance, perhaps the computer blocks a falling meteorite from striking and killing a scientist in the room, who goes on to discover how to create black holes, and uses this knowledge to destroy Mars in a fit of psychosis. If the simulation omits the computer, then it will predict that the meteorite flies past where the computer should be and kills the scientist before his discovery. Therefore the simulation will falsely predict that Mars is still around a year later, when it really is not. In this way, omitting the computer itself from the simulation could lead to drastically wrong predictions.";"4. We cannot know the state of the entire universe.
Due to the finite speed of light, and the fact that nothing can travel faster than light, we can only have knowledge of the parts of the universe that are close enough that there has been enough time since the Big Bang for the light from these parts to reach us. We call this part of the universe the ""observable universe"". We are fundamentally forbidden from knowing anything about regions of the universe outside of the observable universe. At the same time, these regions can still interact with our observable universe and change its evolution if we wait long enough. For instance, a star that is currently just outside of our observable universe could be headed right towards a moon that is on the edge, but just inside, our observable universe. After enough time, the star could enter our observable universe and consume the moon. But we have no way of predicting this event because of our fundamentally limited knowledge of the current state of the entire universe.";behavior,familiar,official,thick,born
Cambridge;A;7010 - Computer Studies;2018;Oct Nov;"Do atoms ever actually touch each other?
";"The answer depends on what you mean by ""touch"". There are three possible meanings of touch at the atomic level: 1) two objects influence each other, 2) two objects influence each other significantly, or 3) two objects reside in the exact same location. Note that the everday concept of touch (i.e the hard boundaries of two objects exist at the same location) makes no sense at the atomic level because atoms don't have hard boundaries. ";"Atoms are not really solid spheres. They are fuzzy quantum probability clouds filled with electrons spread out into waving cloud-like shapes called ""orbitals"". Like a cloud in the sky, an atom can have a shape and a location without having a hard boundary. This is possible because the atom has regions of high density and regions of low density. When we say that an atom is sitting at point A, what we really mean is that the high-density portion of the atom's probability cloud is located at point A. If you put an electron in a box (as is done in quantum dot lasers), that electron is only mostly in the box. Part of the electron's wavefunction leaks through the walls of the box and out to infinity. This makes possible the effect of quantum tunneling, which is used in scanning tunneling microscopes. With the non-solid nature of atoms in mind, let us look at each of the possible meanings of touching.

1. If ""touching"" is taken to mean that two atoms influence each other, then atoms are always touching. Two atoms that are held a mile apart still have their wavefunctions overlapping. The amplitude of one atom's wavefunction at the point where it overlaps with the other atom's center will be ridiculously small if they are a mile apart, but it will not be zero. In principle, two atoms influence each other no matter where they are in the universe because they extend out in all directions. In practice, if two atoms are more than a few nanometers apart, their influence on each other typically becomes so small that it is overshadowed by the influence of closer atoms. Therefore, although two atoms a mile apart may technically be touching (if we define touching as the overlap of atomic wavefunctions), this touching is typically so insignificant that it can be ignored.

What is this ""touching""? In the physical world, there are only four fundamental ways for objects to influence each other: through the electromagnetic force, through the strong nuclear force, through the weak nuclear force, and through the force of gravity. Neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus of an atom are bound to each other and undergo reactions via the two nuclear forces. The electrons that make up the rest of the atom are bound to the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. Atoms are bound into molecules, and molecules are bound into everyday objects by the electromagnetic force. Finally, planets (as well as other large astronomical objects) and macroscopic objects on the planet's surface are bound together by gravity. If two atoms are held a meter apart, they are touching each other through all four fundamental forces. However, for typical atoms, the electromagnetic force tends to dominate over the other forces. What does this touching lead to? If two atoms are too far apart, their interaction is too weak compared to other surrounding bodies to amount to anything. When the two atoms get close enough, this interaction can lead to many things. The entire field of chemistry can be summed up as the study of all the interesting things that happen when atoms get close enough to influence each other electromagnetically. If two atoms are non-reactive and don't form covalent, ionic, or hydrogen bonds, then their electromagnetic interaction typically takes the form of the Van der Walls force. In the Van der Walls effect, two atoms brought close to each other induce electric dipole moments in each other, and these dipoles then attract each other weakly through electrostatic attraction. While the statement that ""all atoms on the planet are always touching all other atoms on the planet"" is strictly true according to this definition of touching, it is not very helpful. Instead, we can arbitrarily define an effective perimeter that contains most of the atom, and then say that any part of the atom that takes extends beyond that perimeter is not worth noticing. This takes us to our next definition of touching.

2. If ""touching"" is taken to mean that two atoms influence each other significantly, then atoms do indeed touch, but only when they get close enough. The problem is that what constitutes ""significant"" is open to interpretation. For instance, we can define the outer perimeter of an atom as the mathematical surface that contains 95% of the atom's electron mass. As should be obvious at this point, a perimeter that contains 100% of the atom would be larger than the earth. With 95% of the atom's electron probability density contained in this mathematical surface, we could say that atoms do not touch until their 95% regions begin to overlap. Another way to assign an effective edge to an atom is to say it exists halfway between two atoms that are covalently bonded. For instance, two hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded to each other to form an H2 molecule have their centers separated by 50 picometers. They can be thought of as ""touching"" at this separation. In this approach, atoms touch whenever they are close enough to potentially form a chemical bond.";"3. If ""touching"" is taken to mean that two atoms reside in the exact same location, then two atoms never touch at room temperature because of the Pauli exclusion principle. The Pauli exclusion principle is what keeps all the atoms in our body from collapsing into one point. Interestingly, at very low temperatures, certain atoms can be coaxed into the exact same location. The result is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate.

Again, atoms never touch in the everyday sense of the word for the simple reason that they don't have hard boundaries. But in every other sense of the word ""touch"" that has meaning at the atomic level, atoms certainly touch.";brought,shut,sister,dawn,furniture
Edexcel;O;4024 - Mathematics D;2018;Oct Nov;"Do flames contain plasma?
";"The answer to this question is more complicated than most people realize. Some flames do contain plasma and some flames do not. To properly answer this question, we really have to first strictly define what we mean by ""plasma"". A textbook definition of a plasma is an ionized gas. ""Ionized gas"" means that some electrons have been ripped completely off the atoms that make up the gas. ";"The effectively-free electrons are negatively charged and the resulting ionized atoms end up positively charged. An ""ion"" is an atom with an unequal number of electrons and protons. This definition is a good starting point, but it is not exact enough. Every gas contains a few ions and freed electrons, and yet not every gas is a plasma. There must by some cutoff point where there are enough ions in the gas that it begins acting like a plasma.

What does it mean to act like a plasma? A plasma is an ionized gas that is reflective to low-frequency electromagnetic waves like radio waves. Described on a more basic level, a plasma shields out electric fields. A plasma is able to do this because enough negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged ions are locally free and are able bind to each other in a long-range, collective way. The collective behavior of ions and electrons means that they are able to respond strongly to incident electric fields and move to cancel out these fields. Therefore, a stricter definition of a plasma is a gas where there are enough freed electrons and ions that they act collectively. The distance that an external electric field can reach into a cloud of charged particles is characterized by the ""Debye length"". The more atoms that are ionized, the stronger the collective oscillations of the charges, and the smaller the Debye length. The strictest definition of a plasma is therefore an ionized gas with enough ionization that the Debye length is significantly smaller than the width of the gas cloud.

In a flame, ionization of the air atoms occurs because the temperature is high enough to cause the atoms to knock into each other and rip off electrons. Therefore, in a flame, the amount of ionization depends on the temperature. (Other mechanisms can lead to ionization. For instance, in lightning, strong electric currents cause the ionization. In the ionosphere, sunlight causes the ionization.) The bottom line is that a flame only becomes a plasma if it gets hot enough. Flames at lower temperatures do not contain enough ionization to become a plasma. On the other hand, a higher-temperature flame does indeed contain enough freed electrons and ions to act as a plasma.";"For example, an everyday wax candle has a flame that burns at a maximum temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius, which is too low to create very many ions. A candle flame is therefore not a plasma. Note that the vibrant red-orange-yellow colors that we see in a flame are not created from the flame being a plasma. Rather, these colors are emitted by incompletely-burnt particles of fuel (""soot"") that are so hot that they are glowing like an electric toaster element. If you pump enough oxygen into a flame, the combustion becomes complete and the red-orange-yellow flame goes away. With this in mind, it should be clear that a candle flame gives off light even though it is not a plasma. In contrast to candle flames, certain burning mixtures of acetylene can reach 3,100 degrees Celsius, with an associated Debye length of 0.01 millimeters, according to the Coalition for Plasma Science. Such flames are therefore plasmas (as long as the flame is much larger than 0.01 millimeters, which is usually the case). Other flames, including flames from campfires, propane stoves, and cigarette lighters, have temperatures that lie somewhere between these two extremes, and therefore may or may not be plasma. Everyday flames such as from the burning of wood, charcoal, gasoline, propane, or natural gas are typically not hot enough to act like a plasma.";them,smoke,third,should,pleasant
Cambridge;O;2281 - Economics,;2002;May Jun;"Does a source of electricity ever run out of electrons?
";The answer to this question depends on the situation. We can roughly classify all electrical systems into two categories: static electricity systems and circuit electricity systems. Note that all electrical effects are actually part of one unified set of physical laws. This classification is therefore ultimately arbitrary and over-simplified. However, this classification is sufficient for our current purpose of understanding electric current.;"A static electricity system involves the flow of electric current as a result of a buildup of electric charge somewhere. Such a system does not involve a closed electrical circuit. Examples of this type of system include lightning and the sparks you get when you rub your feet on a carpet. Electrons naturally repel each other. When a lot of electrons get piled up in one place, they can push on each other so strongly that some of the electrons get pushed right off of the object. They end up getting pushed out through the air, the water, or whatever surrounds the object. We call a collection of moving electrons an electric current, therefore a buildup of charge can drive a current. The electrons simply flow away from the pile and ultimately end up attached to atoms in the environment. In this way, we can have an electric current even if we don't have a complete electrical circuit. In air, an electrical current takes the form of dark discharge, corona discharge, or sparks (depending on if the current is weak, medium strength, or strong, respectively). Note that the name ""static electricity"" is a poor name since the electric charge is not always stationary in this type of system. More accurate names would be ""non-circuit electricity"" or ""charge buildup electricity.""

Since charge buildup is the cause of the electric current in static electricity systems, the current will stop flowing once the buildup goes away. As the electrons flow away from the pile, the pile gets smaller. Eventually, the pile of excess electrons is gone (the electrons that are needed to keep the molecules neutral still remain, but they don't do much). Quite literally, electricity stops flowing because the source runs out of excess electrons. This is why lightning bolts and the sparks between statically-charged socks go away quickly. It's not that electrons are destroyed. Rather, they are leaked away to distant points until none remain.

In contrast, circuit electricity systems involve the flow of electric current through a closed loop. This current is the result of a charge pump operating somewhere in the loop. This pump is also called a voltage source and can take the form of a battery, a solar cell, a generator, or the cord from a power grid. The pump creates a voltage difference along the circuit which drives charges like electrons through the circuit. The pump can either constantly pump electrons in one direction, which leads to a direct current (DC), or it can periodically switch off the direction in which it is pumping electrons, which leads to an alternating current (AC). For simplicity, let's focus on direct current.

As the electrons flow through the circuit, they flow down the potential energy slope that is created by the voltage. Once they reach the pump at the end of the circuit, the low-energy electrons are boosted back up to a high potential energy so that they can start flowing through the circuit again. The situation is a bit like an artificial waterfall in your backyard. Water flows down the waterfall and into a pool because of the natural pull of gravity, just like how electrons flow through the circuit because of the pull of the applied voltage. A water pump then pushes the water in the pool back up to a high energy state at the top of the waterfall, just like how a battery pushes electrons back up to a higher energy state at the beginning of the circuit. The cycle then repeats.

Since the pumping of charge is the cause of the electric current in a circuit electricity system, the current will never stop flowing as long as the pump remains on and the circuit remains uninterrupted. Circuits don't create, destroy, use up, or lose electrons. They just carry the electrons around in circles. For this reason, circuit electrical systems can't really run out of electrons. The energy delivered through a circuit is not the result of electrons existing in the circuit. Electrons always exist in the circuit as part of the atoms and molecules that make up the circuit. The electrical energy that is delivered is the result of the electrons moving through the circuit. Turn off the pump (i.e. disconnect the battery), and the electrons stop moving through the circuit. But the electrons don't go away. They are still there as a natural part of the materials in the circuit.";As I said before, the categorization of systems into static and circuit systems is somewhat arbitrary and oversimplified. Real electrical systems contain a combination of both effects. For instance, a circuit often contains a capacitor. While the circuit acts overall like a circuit electricity system, the capacitor acts more like a static electricity system. As a result, a capacitor can indeed run out of electrons. As soon as one side of the capacitor is depleted of electrons, the electric current stops flowing through the capacitor. At that moment, the part of the circuit containing the capacitor switches from acting like a circuit electricity system to a static electricity system. This happens in the sense that current is now being stopped by a lack of electrons, and not by the lack of an electron pump or the lack of a complete circuit.;studied,planning,share,further,crowd
Cambridge;O;7707 - Accounting;2012;May Jun;"Does an atom have a color?
";"The answer really depends on how you define ""having a color"". The term ""color"" refers to visible light with a certain frequency, or a mixture of visible light frequencies. Therefore, the word ""color"" describes the frequency content of any type of visible light. Anytime visible light is present, we can describe it as having a certain color. With this in mind, there are many different ways an object can reflect or emit visible light. Thus, there are many ways an object can ""have a color"". While a single, isolated, atom can reflect or emit visible light in several of these ways, it does not participate in all the ways. If you define ""having a color"" very narrowly such that it only includes certain mechanisms, then atoms do not have color. If you define ""having a color"" more broadly, then atoms do have a color. Let us look at the different ways an object can reflect or emit visible light and apply each one to an atom.";"1. Bulk reflection, refraction, and absorption
The most common, everyday manner in which objects can send visible light to our eyes is through bulk reflection, refraction, and absorption. These three effects are all part of the same physical mechanism: the interaction of an external beam of light with many atoms at the same time. When white light, which contains all colors, hits the surface of a red apple, the light waves that are orange, yellow, green and blue get absorbed by the atoms in the apple's skin and converted to heat, while the red waves are mostly reflected back to our eyes. Some of the light is also transmitted through the apple skin and bent slightly as it goes through. We call this bent transmission of light ""refraction"". Some materials such as glass transmit a lot of the light while other materials such as apples transmit very little.

The key point here is that traditional reflection, refraction, and absorption constitute a bulk phenomenon where each ray of light interacts with dozens to millions of atoms at the same time. This makes sense when you consider that visible light has a wavelength that is about a thousand times bigger than atoms. Visible light waves have a wavelength from 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, depending on the color. In contrast, atoms have a width of about 0.2 nanometers. This discrepancy is why you can't see individual atoms using an optical microscope. The atoms are far smaller than the light you are trying to use to see them. The color of an object that results from traditional bulk reflection, refraction, and absorption is therefore a result of how several atoms are bound together and arranged, and not a result of the actual color of individual atoms. For example, take carbon atoms and bind them into a diamond lattice, and you get a clear diamonds. In contrast, take carbon atoms and bind them into hexagonal planes and you get gray graphite. The nature of the bonds between many atoms is what determines the traditional color of a material and not the type of atoms themselves. If you have no bonds at all between any atoms, you get a monoatomic gas, which is invisible (at least according to traditional reflection, refraction, and absorption).

The color of most of the everyday objects around us, from apples to pencils to chairs, arises from traditional bulk reflection, refraction, and absorption. This mechanism of light delivery is so common and intuitive that we could define ""having a color"" narrowly to only include this mechanism. With this narrow definition in mind, therefore, a single atom is too small to have a color.

2. Thermal radiation
Heat up a bar of iron enough and it glows red. You could therefore say that the color of a hot iron bar is glowing red. The red color of the iron bar in this case, however, is due to thermal radiation, which is a mechanism that is very different from bulk reflection, refraction, and absorption. In the mechanism of thermal radiation, the atoms of an object knock into each other so violently that they emit light. More accurately, the collisions cause the electrons and atoms to be excited to higher energy states, and then the electrons and atoms emit light when they transition back down to lower energy states. Since the collisions due to thermal motion are random, they lead to a wide range of energy excitations. As a result, the thermal radiation emitted contains many colors that span a broad band of frequencies. The interesting thing about thermal radiation is that its color is more a result of the temperature of the object and less a result of the material of the object. Every solid material glows red if you can get it to the right temperature without it evaporating or chemically reacting. The key to thermal radiation is that it is an emergent property of the interaction of many atoms. As such, a single atom cannot emit thermal radiation. So even if we expand the definition of ""having a color"" to include thermal radiation, individual atoms still have no color.

daytime sky
The daytime sky is an an example of how single, small molecules can exhibit color via Rayleigh scattering. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
3. Rayleigh scattering
More informatively called ""long-wavelength scattering"", Rayleigh scattering is when light does bounce off of single atoms and molecules. But because the light is so much bigger than the atoms, Rayleigh scattering is not really the ""bouncing"" of a light wave off of a small particle such as an atom, but is more a case of immersing the particle in the electric field of the light wave. The electric field induces an oscillating electric dipole in the particle which then radiates. Because the mechanism is so different, Rayleigh scattering of white light off of small particles always creates the same broad range of colors, with blue and violet being the strongest. The color of Rayleigh scattering is always the same (assuming the incident light is white) and is mostly independent of the material of the scattering object.

Therefore, a single atom does have a color in the sense that it participates in Rayleigh scattering. For example, earth's atmosphere is composed mostly of small oxygen molecules (O2) and nitrogen molecules (N2). These molecules are far enough apart that they act like single, isolated molecules. When the daytime white sunlight hits isolated air molecules, it scatters according to Rayleigh scattering, turning the sky whitish-bluish-violet. The fact that we can see the daytime sky attests to the fact that small, individual molecules can exhibit some form of color. While we are talking about small molecules when it comes to the sky, the same principle applies to single atoms. Properly understood, the color in Rayleigh scattering belongs more to the interaction itself than to the actual types of atoms involved. Just because the sky is blue does not necessarily mean that nitrogen atoms are blue. Raman scattering is much rarer than Rayleigh scattering, but is nearly identical in the context of this discussion. Raman scattering is different in that some of the energy of the incident light is lost internally to the particle so that the scattered light is shifted lower in frequency.

neon sign
Neon signs are an example of how single atoms can exhibit color through gas discharge. Public Domain Image, source: NSF.
4. Gas Discharge
Gas discharge (e.g. a Neon light) is perhaps the mechanism that would best fit the notion of an individual atom ""having a color"". Gas discharge is what happens when you take pure atoms, isolate them from each other in a low-density gas state and then excite them using an electric current. When the atoms de-excite, they emit visible light. The key here is that a particular atom can only being excited, de-excited, and emit light in certain ways. This leads to the color of an atom during gas discharge being very strongly tied to the type of atom involved. The frequency spectrum of an atom during gas discharge is considered the color ""fingerprint"" of that particular type of atom. For instance, true neon signs are always red because neon atoms themselves are red under gas discharge. Argon atoms are lavender under gas discharge, while sodium atoms are yellow and mercury atoms are blue. Many of the colors generated by ""Neon"" lights are attained by mixing different gases together. The ""flame test"" used in chemistry to detect certain atoms is essentially a less-controlled, less-pure version of a gas discharge lamp.";"Note that florescence (such as in a florescent light bulb), phosphorescence, and gas laser emission are all similar to gas discharge in that they involve exciting electrons in single atoms or simple molecules. As opposed to gas discharge, which forces an atom to emit all of its characteristic colors; florescence, phosphorescence, and laser emission all involve exploiting certain transitions so that only certain atomic colors are emitted. They can be considered special cases of gas discharge, as far as atomic color characterization is concerned.

There are many other ways an object or material can emit or reflect visible light; such as through semiconductor electron-hole recombination (in LED's), Cherenkov radiation, chemical reactions, synchrotron radiation, or sonoluminescence; but all of these involve the interaction of many atoms or no atoms at all, and so are not pertinent to the current discussion.

In summary: in the sense of traditional reflection, refraction, absorption, and thermal radiation, individual atoms are invisible. In the sense of Rayleigh scattering and gas discharge atoms do have a color.";from,frequently,congress,brought,sitting
Cambridge;A;5070 - Chemistry;2020;May Jun;"Does an electron in an atom move at all?
";"First of all, I assume you meant to ask the question, ""Does an electron in a stable (non-transitioning) atomic state experience any movement?"" Obviously, an electron that is transitioning between states is moving from one state to the other. But for an electron that is just staying in one stable state in an atom, the question is more interesting. Does it move? The answer could be yes or no depending on how we define motion and what form of the electron we consider to be truly real.";"The problem is that an electron is not a solid little ball that we can watch zip around. An electron is a quantum object. As such, an electron is partially particle-like and partially wave-like, but is really something more complex that is neither a simple wave nor a simple particle. The electron is described by a probabilistic quantum wavefunction, which spreads out through space and vibrates, but in such a way that it still has certain discrete properties such as mass. When bound in a stable state in an atom, the electron wavefunction spreads out into a certain shape called an ""orbital"". The orbital does not contain the electron or describe the average location of a little hard electron orbiting around. Rather, the orbital is the electron.

When bound in a stable state in an atom, an electron behaves mostly like an oscillating three-dimensional wave, i.e. the orbital vibrates. It's a bit like a vibrating guitar string. When you pluck a guitar string, you get the string shaking, which is what creates the sound. Scientifically, we would say that you have excited a standing wave in the string. The guitar string is not moving in the sense of shooting off to the other side of the room. In this sense, the guitar string is not moving at all, but remains clamped to the guitar. But the guitar string is moving in the sense that it is vibrating when you pluck it. If you pick one spot on the plucked string and look at it closely, it is definitely moving from one location in space to another, back and forth repeatedly. By pulling the string, you transferred chemical energy in your arm to elastic energy in the stretched string. When you let go, the elastic energy was converted to motional energy (kinetic energy) as the string snapped back and started vibrating. The total kinetic energy of the entire string averaged over time is zero, since the overall string is not going anywhere with respect to the guitar. But the kinetic energy of any small part of the string at a given moment is not zero. In this way, a plucked guitar string experiences local motion but not overall motion.

Mathematical plots of the electron wavefunction in hydrogen, showing clearly its vibrational movement. The plots on the left and right each show a single electron in the ground state of a single hydrogen atom. The two plots in the middle show the two possible ground states that an electron wavefunction can take when two hydrogen atoms are bound into a hydrogen molecule. Each red dot shows the location of a nucleus. In each plot, the blue curve/pink curve pair shows the two different wavefunction components of a single electron. Note that these plots show a one-dimensional slice of a three-dimensional orbital. Public Domain Image, source: Wikipedia.
An electron in an atomic orbital state acts somewhat like a plucked guitar string. It is spread out in a three-dimensional cloud-like wavefunction that vibrates. Whereas a guitar string vibrates up and down, an atomic electron wavefunction simply vibrates strong and weak. The frequency at which the electron wavefunction vibrates is directly proportional to the total energy of the electron. Electrons in higher-energy atomic states vibrate more quickly. Because an electron is a quantum object with wave-like properties, it must always be vibrating at some frequency. In order for an electron to stop vibrating and therefore have a frequency of zero, it must be destroyed. In an atom, this happens when an electron is sucked into the nucleus and takes part in a nuclear reaction known as electron capture.

With all of this in mind, an electron in a stable atomic state does not move in the sense of a solid little ball zipping around in circles like how the planets orbit the sun, since the electron is spread out in a wave. Furthermore, an electron in a stable atomic state does not move in the sense of waving through space. The orbital electron does move in the sense of vibrating in time.

But the truth is more complicated than this simple picture depicts. There are two things that describe the electron in quantum theory: the electron's quantum wavefunction, and the magnitude squared of the electron's quantum wavefunction. (The ""magnitude squared"" operation just means that you drop phase factors such as negative signs and then take the square. For instance, the magnitude squared of negative three is nine.) Interestingly, experiments can only directly measure the magnitude squared of the electron wavefunction, and yet we need the original wavefunction in order to predict the outcome of many experiments. For this reason, some people say that the magnitude squared of the wavefunction is the only real entity, whereas the original wavefunction itself is just a mathematical crutch that is needed because our theory is inelegant.";"Is the magnitude squared of the electron wavefuntion the real physical entity or is the original wavefunction the real physical entity? This question is really a philosophical one and not a physical one, so I will not pursue the question here. To scientists, the question, ""What is actually real?"" is unimportant. We are more concerned with making the equations match the experiments. So what does all this have to do with an electron in an atom? The point is that an atomic electron's raw wavefunction does vibrate, but the magnitude squared of the wavefunction does not vibrate. In fact, physicists call stable atomic electron states ""stationary states"" because the magnitude squared of the wavefunction is constant in time. If you consider the raw wavefunction to be the truly physical entity, then you have to say that an electron in an atom experiences motion in the form of a vibration. If you consider the magnitude squared of the wavefunction to be the truly physical entity, then you have to say that an electron in an atom experiences no vibration, and therefore no motion. I consider the first choice to make more sense. You can mathematically show that certain atomic electron states contain angular momentum (i.e. rotational momentum). It's hard to make sense of the claim that an atomic electron contains angular momentum and at the same claim that the electron is completely motionless in every sense of the word. For this reason, I prefer to view the raw wavefunction as the truly physical entity, and therefore an electron in an atom experiences motion in the form of vibrations. But, again, the question, ""What is actually real?"" is a philosophical one and is unimportant in science. The bottom line is that the raw wavefunction of an electron in a stable atomic state experiences vibrational motion. Whether you consider this motion real or not is up to you.";nature,whistle,lead,add,rabbit
Cambridge;AS;1123 - English Language;2015;May Jun;"Does the negative mass of antimatter mean that it's gravitationally repelled from stars?
";Antimatter does not have negative mass. In our universe, there is no such thing as negative mass. Mass only comes in positive form. In contrast, electric charge can be positive or negative. The nonexistence of negative mass has profound consequences.;"First, gravity is always attractive and never repulsive. Presumably, if negative mass existed, it would be repelled by objects with positive mass such as the earth or sun. A cup made out of negative mass would fall up and not down when you let it go. As interesting as this sounds, negative mass does not exist, so heavier objects always fall down. Second, the lack of negative mass means that gravitational fields can never be shielded, blocked, or canceled. In contrast, electric charge comes in both positive and negative varieties. An electric field created by a positively charged object can therefore be blocked by a wall of negative charges. This is the principle used in metal shielding, which keeps the microwaves in a microwave oven from cooking everything in the kitchen. But there is no negative mass to cancel out gravity. If negative mass did exist, you could use it as a form of anti-gravity. If you built a floor on earth out of negative mass of sufficient size, then people above that floor would feel no gravity and would float around. Again, negative mass does not exist, so genuine anti-gravity is not possible. Gravity permeates every cell of every creature, and into the deepest dungeon with the thickest walls.

Antimatter is a physical entity with positive mass that is identical to regular matter in every way except that the charge and some other properties are flipped. Every bit of matter in the universe has a potential antimatter counterpart. Every fundamental particle of regular matter has an antimatter version. For instance, the antimatter version of the electron is the positron. Electrons and positron have the exact same mass, the same spin, and the same charge magnitude. The only difference is that electrons are negatively charged and positrons are positively charged (positrons should not be confused with protons which are completely different particles) and a few other properties are flipped. When an electron meets a positron, they annihilate each other and their combined mass is converted completely into energy in the form of gamma rays. This effect is used routinely in medical PET scans. In general, antimatter annihilates its regular matter version when they meet. Antimatter can be thought of as regular matter traveling backwards in time. In this picture, a particle-antiparticle annihilation event can be thought of as a forward-time-traveling particle being knocked by gamma rays so that it becomes the same particle, but just traveling backwards in time. Note that this time travel concept applies only to specific antimatter events that obey the conservation of energy and does not open up the possibility for humans to travel back in time, which would violate the conservation of energy. Although antimatter comes in very small quantities in our universe, it is not as exotic or unnatural as once thought.";Every minute of every day, high energy cosmic rays from distant supernovas are slamming into earth's atmosphere and creating a very small amount of antimatter. Also, the natural radioactive decay that takes place constantly in earth's rocks creates small amounts of antimatter. But this antimatter does not stick around for long because it quickly bumps up against regular matter and destroys itself in the process.;he,differ,tightly,familiar,standard
Cambridge;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2020;Aug Sep;"Does time go faster at the top of a building compared to the bottom?
";"Yes, time goes faster the farther away you are from the earth's surface compared to the time on the surface of the earth. This effect is known as ""gravitational time dilation"". It is predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity and has by verified multiple times by experiments.";"Gravitational time dilation occurs because objects with a lot of mass create a strong gravitational field. The gravitational field is really a curving of space and time. The stronger the gravity, the more spacetime curves, and the slower time itself proceeds. We should note here, however, that an observer in the strong gravity experiences his time as running normal. It is only relative to a reference frame with weaker gravity that his time runs slow. A person in strong gravity therefore sees his clock run normal and sees the clock in weak gravity run fast, while the person in weak gravity sees his clock run normal and the other clock run slow. There is nothing wrong with the clocks. Time itself is slowing down and speeding up because of the relativistic way in which mass warps space and time.

Gravitational time dilation occurs whenever there is difference in the strength of gravity, no matter how small that difference is. The earth has lots of mass, and therefore lots of gravity, so it bends space and time enough to be measured. As a person gets farther away from the surface of the earth â€“ even just a few meters â€“ the gravitational force on that person gets weaker. We don't notice it much as humans, but even going from the first floor of a building to the second floor of a building moves you away from the earth and therefore slightly weakens the gravitational force that you feel. The difference in gravity between that felt at three meters above the surface of the earth and that felt at four meteres is too small to notice with our human senses, but the difference is large enough for sensitive machines to pick up.";Because the strength of gravity is weakening with every step you take up a flight of stairs, the rate at which time proceeds is also speeding up with every step. People who work on the bottom floor of a skyscraper are literally time traveling into the future compared to the people who work on the top floor. But the effect is very small. So small, in fact, that you will never notice the time difference in everyday life. People who live and work farther away from the surface of the earth are only fractions of a nanosecond ahead per year compared to those close to the surface. Though small, the time rate difference between different altitudes is real and has been measured experimentally using very accurate atomic clocks. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has measured such small time rate differences and published its findings. NIST was able to measure the small time rate difference between a point on the earth and a point half a meter higher, by simply raising their experimental table a half of a meter. Their findings matched well the time dilation predicted by Einstein's relativity. The time dilation due to earth's gravity is significant enough that the GPS satellites, which orbit high above the earth, must adjust their internal clocks in order to take into account their faster time and therefore accurately determine the location of GPS receivers on the ground.;glass,freedom,actual,liquid,personal
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2001;Jan Feb;"How bad would a person's injuries be if an elevator's cables snapped at the 100th floor so that the elevator fell to the bottom?
";Elevator's cables almost never snap. And if a cable did snap, there are backup cables attached. Even if all the cables snapped, an elevator still would not fall to the bottom floor.;"Elevators have a passive, automatic, built-in braking system. The brakes require no electricity, no remote control, and no human operator. These brakes lock in place whenever the elevator starts to fall faster than an allowed amount. The brakes are passive in the sense that it takes no energy, computer, or external agent to turn them on. They still work if the power goes out or if no one is paying attention. This is possible because the brakes are simple mechanical devices. It is the initial falling motion of the elevator itself that engages the brakes. Way back in 1852 Elisha Otis invented this automatic braking system, as documented in the book ""Otis: Giving Rise to the Modern City"" by Jason Goodwin. His safety elevator has been in use ever since. If you were to be on an elevator where all the cables snapped, you would not feel much. The elevator would only fall a few feet and then stop. This is such a small amount that you wouldn't even think that you had been falling in the first place. You would think simply that a door had jammed or a motor had hiccupped."; You may well ask: what would happen if all the cables snapped and the automatic brakes failed. Then, yes, the elevator would fall to the bottom floor. But in order to fail completely, the brakes have to be physically damaged by a significant accident, such as a colliding airplane. In that case, you have more to worry about than your elevator.;done,congress,salt,flat,fell
Cambridge;O;2210 - Computer Science;2001;Aug Sep;How can a clear object be transparent and visible at the same time?;Clear objects are visible because they bend the light as it passes through. There are four basic things that can happen to light when it hits an object:;"Specular Reflection: Think of a mirror or metal spoon. The light bounces off the object's surface like a billiard ball, allowing the original image to be seen in the object.
Diffuse Reflection: Think of raw wood, flowers, or non-glossy painted surfaces. The light bounces off the object's surface in all directions, revealing the shape and color of the object.
Absorption: Think of a black piece of coal or ash. The light enters the object where it is absorbed and converted to heat.
Transmission/Refraction: Think of a glass of water. The light travels straight through the object but the direction it is traveling bends when entering and leaving the object.
In reality, all materials interact with light in all four ways. For instance, consider the hood of a red sports car. Some of the light is reflected specularly (leading to the glare spots you see and the image of trees reflected off the car). Some of the light is reflected diffusely (leading to the red color you see). Some of the light is absorbed (leading to the orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet light you don't see because it is absorbed â€“ if these colors were not absorbed, the car would look white and not red). Also, some of the light is transmitted/refracted (very little actually).

For many materials, there may be one dominant way it interacts with light, so that the other ways are so small that they can be ignored. For instance, water does indeed absorb some red light (that is why the ocean is blue), and water does indeed reflect some light (that is why there is glare from the sun on the water's surface), but for the most part we can think of water as a clear material because transmission/refraction dominates.

Now, the interesting part is that each of the four interactions listed above alters the light. Our brains are able to detect this alteration in the light and deduce the presence and shape of an object from this information. Strictly speaking, we never see an ""object"". We see ""light"" that has been altered by an object. That is why it is so difficult to build machines that can see the way humans do: there is a great deal of intelligence required to deduce an object's shape and location from a pattern of light that it has altered.

When it comes to clear objects, we see them because we see the way light bends (refracts) as it passes through the objects. Look closely at a glass cup. When you look at the glass cup, what do you see? You just see an image of whatever is behind the cup, but distorted. Refraction bends the light as it passes through the cup and the background image ends up changed. Your brain is smart enough to be able to deduce the shape of the cup simply by how the background image is distorted.";This leads us to an interesting notion. If the refraction of a a clear material can be mostly canceled, the object can be made virtually invisible. One way to cancel refraction effects is to shape a clear material into a very flat slab with parallel surfaces. When light enters the slab, it bends, but when it leaves the slab out the other side it bends back by the same amount. As a result, the image coming out the other side is undistorted and the slab is effectively invisible. This is the principle behind windows. Windows are made out of clear glass and fashioned to be very flat, so that you can't actually see the window. You see the landscape beyond the window as if the window were not there (windows are not completely invisible because they do reflect a small amount of light which can be detected under the right conditions).;planning,lead,thick,cry,furniture
Cambridge;A;2281 - Economics,;2013;Jan Feb;"How can a material at a certain temperature have all of its molecules at the same energy?
";"A material at a certain temperature does not have all of its particles at the same energy. In the basic definition of the word, ""temperature"" is the average random motional (kinetic) energy of the particles of a material. (Thermodynamics gives a broader definition to temperature, but we don't need this definition here.) Did you notice the word ""average"" in the basic definition? Just because we can assign a single number to the temperature of an object that is in thermal equilibrium does not mean that every atom of the material is moving with the same energy because of the nature of averaging.";"If the average height of everyone in the room is 5 feet 9 inches, this does not imply that everyone in the room is 5 feet 9 inches tall. Some people will be 6 feet tall while others will be 5 feet 6 inches tall. The average of a set of a values only gives us a general idea of the group as a whole and does not tell us about any individual in the group. In the same way, the atoms in a material are all moving at different speeds and with different energies, even when the material has a constant and uniform temperature. Some of the atoms are moving faster than the speed corresponding to the material's temperature and some of the atoms are moving slower. A few of the atoms are moving much faster than what is implied by the temperature.

Returning to the example of people in a room, if you had several hundred people in a room, measured everyone's height, and plotted a distribution of the number of people versus height, you would most likely find a curve that is somewhat smooth and shaped like a bell. Many people will have a height that is very close to the average height and only a few people will have a height that is very different from the average height. The average height is therefore a good indication of the approximate height of most of the people in the room. The more people there are in the room, the more smooth and bell-like our height distribution will be. Similarly, the temperature of a material tells us the approximate location of the smooth distribution of the atomic kinetic energies.

Why are the atoms of a material moving with different energies? It is because thermal motion is random motion. When randomness is involved, many outcomes will result despite underlying laws making certain outcomes more likely. For instance, if you take two six-sided dice and roll them, you could get any number between 2 and 12. The most likely roll is a 7 because there are so many different ways to combine the numbers 1 through 6 of one die with the numbers 1 through 6 of the other die and end up with the total 7. If you rolled these dice a thousand times, you would indeed find that you roll the number 7 most often. But you will still roll all the other possible numbers eventually because the rolling of dice is a random process.

When a system of particles has had the chance to settle into thermal equilibrium, the distribution of its particles' energies spread out over what is called a ""thermal distribution"". In a rough sense, the temperature of a system represents the center of its thermal distribution of particle energies. The existence of a broad thermal distribution of energies has significant implications. If we take the half of the particles in the system with the most energy and throw them away; in essence, chopping off the top half of the thermal distribution; then the midpoint of the distribution will be lower. Therefore, the temperature of the system will be decreased. This process is known as ""evaporative cooling"". For example, the water vapor coming out of your hot tea contains the hotter particles, so that the water that is left behind is colder on average.";Another important implication is that even if the temperature of a system is below some critical threshold, there will still be some particles that are energetic enough to surmount the threshold. For instance, in a semiconductor, the outermost electron states have a base energy that is too low to be in the conduction band. The conduction band is the state in which electrons become free and can form electrical currents. Despite the base energy being too low, many outer electrons in the semiconductor indeed have enough energy to jump into the conduction band and form an electrical current. The hotter a semiconductor gets, the more its thermal distribution of outer electrons spreads out, and the more electrons there are in the conduction band to form a current.;anyway,sister,care,rapidly,chance
Cambridge;AS;4024 - Mathematics D;2008;Aug Sep;"How can an electron leap between atomic levels without passing through all the space in between?
";An electron that is transitioning between two atomic states does not skip any intervening space. The idea of a quantum leap is highly misleading and commonly misunderstood. First of all, an electron is a quantum object. As such, it acts both as a wave and as a particle at the same time. When bound as part of an atom, an electron mostly acts like a wave.;"An atomic electron spreads out into cloud-like wave shapes called ""orbitals"". If you look closely at the various orbitals of an atom (for instance, the hydrogen atom), you see that they all overlap in space. Therefore, when an electron transitions from one atomic energy level to another energy level, it does not really go anywhere. It just changes shape. The orbital shapes with more fluctuations (with more highs, lows, and bends to its shape) contain more energy. In other words, when an electron transitions to a lower atomic energy level, its wave shape changes to have less kinks in it. But the electron does not ""leap"" anywhere.

The wave behavior of an electron in an atom is very similar to the behavior of classical waves on a guitar string. When you pluck a guitar string, you excite standing waves in the string, which are what make the sound. A certain string can only experience certain types of standing waves because the string is clamped down on both ends. The types of waves allowed on a particular string are called its ""harmonics"". The harmonics of a string depend on the string's length, tension, and mass density. A particular guitar string (of a particular length, tension, and mass) can therefore only play a certain type of sound, which is a combination of its harmonics.

If you are very careful about how you pluck the string, you can create a wave on the string which is mostly the lower, fundamental harmonic (which has very few kinks), or you can create a wave on the string which is mostly a higher harmonic (which has many kinks). It takes more energy and is therefore harder to strongly excite the higher harmonic in a guitar string. Furthermore, if you pluck the string properly so as to strongly excite a higher harmonic wave in the string, you can even coax the string to transition down to the lower-energy harmonic. The wave on the guitar string does not go anywhere when the string transitions from a higher-energy state to a lower-energy state. The wave just changes shape. In a similar way, the discrete set of electron orbitals possible in a certain atom are effectively the harmonics of the atom. The electron can transition to a higher harmonic wave shape by absorbing energy and kinking more, or transition to a lower harmonic wave shape by emitting energy and kinking less (relaxing).

It should be clear at this point that an electron that transitions in an atom does not make any kind of leap from one location in space to another location in space. But you may still be worried that the electron makes a leap from one energy level to another, and therefore bypasses all the in-between energy states. Although we are talking about a leap on the energy scale, and not a leap in space, such a leap may still strike you as unnatural, as it should. The fact is that an electron transitioning in an atom does not actually discontinuously leap from one energy level to another energy level, but makes a smooth transition. You may wonder, ""Doesn't quantum theory tell us that an electron in an atom can only exist at certain, discrete energy levels?"" Actually, no. Quantum theory tells us that an electron with a stationary energy can only exist at certain, discrete energy levels. This distinction is very important. By ""stationary energy"" we mean that the electron's energy stays constant for a fairly long period of time. The orbitals of a particular atom are not the only allowed states that an electron can take on in the atom. They are the only stable states of the atom, meaning that when an electron settles down to a particular state in an atom, it must be in one of the orbital states.";"When an electron is in the process of transitioning between stable states, it is not itself stable and therefore has less restrictions on its energy. In fact, an electron that transitions does not even have a well-defined energy. Innate quantum uncertainty arises in the electron's energy because of its transition. The quicker an electron transitions, the more uncertain its energy. This ""innate quantum uncertainty"" is not some metaphysical mystery, but is better understood as the wave spreading out over many values. Just as the electron can spread out into a wave that extends over a region of space, it can also spread out into a wave that extends over a region along the energy scale. If you calculate the average energy (the ""expectation value"") of this transitioning electron's spread of energies, you find that the electron's average energy does not instantaneously jump from one energy level to another. Rather, it smoothly transitions on average from the one energy level to the other energy level over a period of time. There is really no ""instantaneous quantum leap"" at all. The electron does not leap in space, and it does not leap up the energy scale. In fact, the term ""quantum leap"" is almost universally shunned by scientists as it is highly misleading. If you want a better mental image, you can think of the electron as quickly, but smoothly sliding along the energy scale from one stable state to the next. Because a typical atomic electron transition is so fast (often on the order of nanoseconds), it can seem to be nearly instantaneous to the slow human senses, but fundamentally it is not.";dropped,found,danger,touch,actual
Cambridge;A;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2017;Aug Sep;"How can it be so hard to drag rubber across smooth glass if friction is caused by surface roughness?
";"Friction is not caused mainly by surface roughness. According to the book ""Sliding Friction"" by Bo N. J. Persson, friction is caused by weak electromagnetic forces between molecules, such as experienced in hydrogen bonds and Van der Waal bonds. If two electrically neutral, non-polar atoms are brought close enough together, they induce electric dipole moments in each other which then attract.";These weak bonds cause the two objects with surfaces touching to be attracted, making it hard to slide one object along the other. Additionally, the sliding motion can generate vibrations (phonons) in the objects touching, which takes energy away from the sliding motion and therefore slows down the objects. Because friction is mainly caused by electrical attraction and not surface roughness, smooth objects can still have relatively high friction coefficients. In fact, nanoscopically smooth objects experience very high friction (as long as their chemical structure promotes significant electromagnetic forces) because they have much more of their surface in contact. Surface roughness can become significant if the roughness is very high. The best way to lower the friction of a surface is to combat both. Smooth down the surface to lower surface roughness, and then sprinkle on a lubricant which gets in the way of the chemical bonding, such as oil or graphite.;;danger,pound,directly,especially,room
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2014;Jan Feb;How can we travel to the past?;Mainstream science dictates that time travel to the past is impossible. The basic problem with time travel to the past is conservation of energy. For example, pretend I made a time travel portal that sends objects back three seconds in time to the exact same location, and I mount this portal a few inches above a trampoline. I turn the portal on and one second later drop a charged battery into the portal.;"It falls, appears three seconds earlier, before the portal was turned on, and bounces off the trampoline to a point above the portal. Three seconds later, there I am dropping the original battery and next to it is the battery that time traveled and bounced. The portal turns on and both batteries now fall through the portal. The cycle repeats itself automatically without human intervention. All I had to do was turn on the portal and drop the first battery. Two batteries become four, which become eight, and so on. A businessman might say, ""Great! Free batteries. Let's sell them and make a fortune!"" But the point is that once I flick on the portal and drop the first battery, the rest is entirely automatic. This means there would be no way to stop it. Keep in mind that this chain reaction is not happening at progressively later points in time. It is all happening in the same three-second loop of time. That one battery would instantly become an infinite number of batteries. They would fill the entire universe, crush us to death, and explode with all of this runaway energy.

The law of local conservation of energy is universal, and it's a good thing. It's what keeps our universe from exploding in an instant into an infinite fireball of energy. It's also what rules out time travel to the past. If the presence of a human in our scenario bothers you, we could do without him. We could just as easily have an acorn fall from a tree through a three-second time-travel portal created by a cosmic ray and bounce off the trampoline without any humans around. The explosion of the universe would still occur. The fact that the universe is still around is ample evidence that time travel to the past is impossible. Note that we have not used any ethical or social arguments involving killing your own grandfather. Time travel to the past is forbidden by simple physics even in the absence of humans. While movies about time travel to the past can be creative and thought-provoking, they are simply wrong. There are many speculative theories about time travel to the past, some made by respected physicists, but mainstream physics does not allow it.

On the other hand, time travel to the future is allowed and indeed has been measured experimentally. Relativity dictates that the rate of the forward march of time is dependent on both the speed of your reference frame as well as the strength of the gravitational field in your frame. We can travel into the future by either spending time in a vehicle traveling very fast relative to earth or by spending time in a very strong gravitational field. In both cases, time travel does not allow skipping to some future time. All reference frames must experience all seconds in the day. Rather, time just goes slower in such reference frames.";"If your local time runs fast on account of high speed or gravity, you can experience an hour while earth experiences two. Such time travel is verified experimentally every day by equipment that deal with precise time measurements, such as GPS satellites. Unfortunately, the time dilation effect is very weak. The highest speeds and strongest gravity that men can currently attain only transports them milliseconds into the future.

Edexcel;AS;4024 - Mathematics D;2016;Oct Nov;"How did Archimedes use mirrors to burn up invaders' ships?
";Archimedes did not use mirrors to burn up the Roman invaders' ships. This myth claims that by focusing the sun's rays, Archimedes' mirrors raised the temperature of the ships enough that they caught fire. While a concave mirror held in one hand can light a paper in the other hand by focusing sunlight, burning a distant wooden ship would require an impractically large mirror.;"As published in the European Journal of Physics under the title ""Reflections on the â€˜Burning Mirrors of Archimedes',"" the scientists A. A. Mills and R. Clift calculate that 440 flat square meter mirrors would be needed to smolder wood at a distance of 50 meters. Even then, smoldering wood can be extinguished easy with a splash of salt water. It would be impractical for the Greeks to produce, perfectly align, and effectively use 440 mirrors in 214 BC.

The problem is three-fold. First, ships that are far enough away to safely assault with sunlight would be too far away to reliably focus the sunlight. Secondly, ships are made out of sea-worthy wood which is much harder to light than paper. Third, sunlight only carries so much energy, even if perfectly focused. It takes a very large effective mirror to focus the sunlight to useful intensities. For example, the Sierra SunTower solar power plant uses 24,000 flat mirrors spread over 20 acres in order to focus sunlight onto two boilers. The focused sunlight at the SunTower is used to boil water, and then the resulting steam is used to turn electrical generators."; Even though Archimedes' soldiers could not have used mirrors to burn the Romans' ships, this myth may have some basis in fact. Perhaps the mirrors were used to blind, confuse, or even burn the on-board Romans.;limited,brick,personal,height,acres

";"The shape of the wings is not the main reason that airplanes fly. Rather, the angle of attack for the wings is what creates most of the lift, as laid out in the book ""Flight Physics"" by Egbert Torenbeek and H. Wittenberg. The role angle of attack plays in flight is explained in detail by NASA's education website.";If the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom of the wing, then air pressure does indeed decrease over the wing and help to suck up the wing. But this is not the main effect. When a wing is tilted with the leading edge up relative to the incoming wind, the air tends to pile up under the wing, causing high pressure that pushes the wing up. The wing is riding on top of a bubble of dense air. This is the same reason kites fly. Even a perfectly flat-winged airplane can fly if it tilts its wings. You can literally get a brick to experience lift with a strong enough motor and the right orientation of the brick. Stunt planes that are meant to fly upside down have symmetrical wings. They don't rely at all on wing shape for lift.;To fly upside down, a stunt plane just tilts its wings in the right direction.;bend,again,parallel,touch,height
Edexcel;A;5054 - Physics;2003;Oct Nov;"How do free energy machines work?
";Free energy machines do not work. No machine can create energy out of nothing, as this would violate the law of mass-energy conservation, which is fundamental and universal. The law of mass-energy conservation states that mass-energy can never be created or destroyed. It can only be redistributed throughout space and transformed into different states.;"Mass can be converted to energy, and energy can be converted to mass, but together they must be conserved. For instance, when a positron from the tracer liquid of a medical PET scan hits an electron in the patient's body, the positron and electron completely destroy each other and all of their mass is converted into energy. This energy is emitted as two gamma particles (high energy light) that fly off in nearly opposite directions. The PET machine detects the gamma rays, uses them to pinpoint the location of the positron-electron annihilation event, and therefore discovers where in the patient's body the tracer liquid is congregating. Nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors also convert mass to energy, but the conversion is very inefficient and only a fraction of the bomb's mass is converted to energy. Mass is also converted to energy during radioactive decay.

PET medical scanner
PET medical scanners depend crucially on the law of conservation of mass-energy holding true. Public Domain Image, source: NIH.
In contrast, energy is converted to mass in particle accelerators such as the LHC. In particle accelerators, large tracks of magnets speed up particles such as electrons and protons to incredible speeds. The particles have therefore gained a high amount of kinetic energy from the magnets. The particles are then guided to collide with a stationary target (or collide with other particles that have been accelerated in the opposite direction). Upon collision, the kinetic energy is lost because the particles are stopped. But energy cannot just be destroyed; it must go somewhere. As a result, the energy is converted to mass and hundreds of new particles are created in the collision. These new particles are detected and give physicists clues about what types of particles can exist. Every time a particle accelerator is used, a nuclear reactor is turned on, or a medical PET scan is taken, the conservation of mass-energy is experimentally verified. In fact, the energy taken in or given off by ordinary chemical reactions results from the transformation of energy to mass and mass to energy. In chemical reactions, the mass of the system before the reaction is different from the mass of the system after the reaction. The mass difference is miniscule, but measurable, and is the source of the energy. Because of this fact, every chemical experiment ever done is a validation of the conservation of mass-energy. Out of all the scientifically-sound, repeatable experiments ever performed, a violation of the conservation of mass-energy has never been observed. If the law was broken, and energy was created out of nothing, then the first place it would be observed would be in particle accelerators. Particle accelerators have huge stacks of sensitive detectors that can track the movement of every last bit of mass and energy in the system; electrons, protons, photons, etc. Additionally, the accelerators pump incredible amounts of energy into the particles, so that exotic and rare phenomena are readily observable. If a bit of energy did appear that was unaccounted for, the detectors would see it, but they never have.

Beyond overwhelming experimental verification, the law of conservation of mass-energy is required by theory. If energy could pop into existence out of nothing, then in such a big, old universe, energy would eventually pop out of nothing. With the limiting mechanism of conservation out of the way, the energy that pops out of nothing could be as large as infinite. As the age of the universe becomes large, the probability that an infinite energy will pop out of nothing would become 100%. The problem is that an infinite energy (or even a non-infinite one that is large enough) would destroy our universe. The fact that our universe is still around is direct evidence that the law of conservation of mass-energy is fundamental and universal. If this law applied on earth, but not on Alpha Centauri, then infinite energy would pop out of nothing on Alpha Centauri and destroy the universe. The universality of mass-energy conservation is literal and strict. People who believe in free energy machines must also logically believe that the universe does not exist.

Proponents of free energy may argue that conservation of mass-energy is usually obeyed, but can be broken in exotic experiments. The center of stars and supernova are far more exotic environments than a tinkerer's basement. Violation of mass-energy conservation would be observed far sooner and far more easily in a star than in an inventor's table-top contraption. And yet, it has never been observed. Free energy can be tempting to people who want something for nothing. If you could build a machine that created energy out of nothing, then you could sell the energy and everyone would get rich without ever doing any work.

Free energy machines that seem like they should work are always the product of wishful thinking and sloppy science. If you build a machine and underestimate the amount of mass-energy you have to put into the machine to get it going, and overestimate the amount of mass-energy it will output once going, then your calculations predict that mass-energy has been created out of nothing. But this end result came from poor estimations, and not from ground-breaking science. Most people who ""feel"" like a certain free energy machine should work simply don't grasp how much mass-energy it takes to get the machine going. For instance, magnetic free energy machines are essentially spinning electromagnetic motors. The machine is plugged into an electrical source, which gets the motor's wheel spinning. The machine is then unplugged and the wheel keeps spinning under its own inertia. Then electrical energy is extracted from the spinning wheel. This energy was not created out of nothing. It was put in the wheel by the original electrical power inputted to the motor. The electric power extracted from the wheel in the end will always be less than the electrical power put into the wheel in the first place. Energy is simply converted from electrical to kinetic (the spinning motion of the wheel is a form of energy), and then back to electrical, while some of the energy is converted to waste heat due to friction. When the inventor of a ""free energy"" or ""over unity"" machine claims that his invention really creates energy out of nothing, he is either deluding himself or is outright lying to take advantage of others. The self-delusion usually happens because the inventor does not realize the large amount of external energy he has put into his machine to turn it on, which is more than he could ever get out. A straight-forward measurement of all the energy being inputted to his machine and all the energy being outputted would quickly reveal no actual free energy. But doing real science is hard, so countless ""inventors"" tinker in their garage and think that ""pretty spinning wheel"" = ""free energy"" without doing any actual measurements. For those who do take actual measurements, they think they are always just one step behind from reaching over-unity performance; believing that adding just one more complicated gadget to their machine will put them over the top, when in fact they never actually reach a free-energy result.

Consider a canal of water that flows through a turbine. The turbine generates electricity. The electricity is then used to pump all of the water from the bottom of the canal to the top of the canal where it can enter into the turbine again and repeat the cycle. This seems like a closed system that could run forever and continually output electricity; it's free energy! But if you actually do measurements or calculations, you will find that the electrical energy generated by the turbines will never be enough to pump all the water back to the top of the canal. It would require externally provided energy to get the water back to the top and thereby run continuously. But at that point, it's not a a free energy machine. It's just a complicated wheel running on external power. River turbines do extract energy from rivers, but this energy does not come out of nowhere. The river water gained its gravitational potential energy when it was placed at the river head by the evaporation-precipitation process. River water was once ocean water that absorbed sunlight energy from the sun and converted it to gravitational potential energy as it evaporated. The energy outputted by the sun results from mass being converted to energy in its core. The mass of the sun was created by slow accumulation of intergalactic dust that was created by the Big Bang. Because mass-energy cannot be created or destroyed, every bit of mass-energy in the universe can be traced back to its creation in the Big Bang. Real river turbines don't generate energy from nothing. They are simply extracting energy created by the Big Bang and converting it to a useful form.

Some people misunderstand vacuum energy and believe it is a form of free energy that can be extracted. An absolute vacuum indeed contains quantum fluctuations, but these do not constitute usable energy. The effects of vacuum energy are already factored into everyday reactions. In the strict sense, you are already using the effects of vacuum energy every time you light a candle or drive your car, but there is still no permanent removal of energy from the vacuum. Every particle is ""dressed"" or surrounded by a cloud of quantum fluctuations in addition to its regular fields. If you were somehow to remove the cloud, the particle would be left naked and would interact very differently with the world. The mass-energy gained by removing the cloud would cancel the mass-energy lost by changing the way the particle interacts with the world, so in the end mass-energy would still be conserved. You would still end up with the total energy created from nothing equaling zero. For instance, in the Casimir effect, two plates are placed very close together so that the cloud of quantum fluctuations in between the plates is less dense than the cloud surrounding the plates. As a result, the plates attract each other. It would seem that this effect extracts energy from nothing. In reality, the energy that comes out of the system in the form of moving plates comes from the particles in the plates. As their cloud of quantum fluctuations changes, they lose mass. Even quantum fluctuations obey the law of conservation of mass-energy.";"Historically, free energy machines were called ""perpetual motion"" machines. This name is confusing because perpetual motion is possible, you just can't extract free energy from an object in perpetual motion. The earth is in perpetual motion as it repeatedly orbits the sun. If we were to build a giant generator and extract a large portion of the energy contained in the earth's orbital motion, it would destroy the orbit and the earth would spiral into the sun. From a socioeconomic perspective, it should also be obvious that free-energy machines don't work. If a free-energy machine actually worked, it would make its inventor instantly rich. If such free-energy machines were possible, high-tech corporations such as Intel or Apple would pursue them because they would literally yield an infinite return on investment. And yet, no big-name technology company sells free-energy machines, or is even researching their possibility. Corporations know that reading up on, researching, or developing free energy machines is a futile waste of time and energy that is better diverted to more productive channels.";model,syllable,its,were,enjoy
Edexcel;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2012;Oct Nov;"How do levers create energy if the conservation of energy does not allow energy to be created?
";Levers do not create energy. Levers convert a small force applied over a long distance to a large force applied over a small distance. Work is the force times the distance, W = Fd, so the total work done is the same with or without the lever. Look closely at a lever as you use it. The end that lifts the fridge moves a very small distance d as the job is carried out, but the end of the lever that your hand is pushing on moves a large distance as the job is carried out.;"Because the total work done must be constant, and work is force times distance, the force must go up if the distance goes down. The lever converts the little force of your hand at one end to a large force at the other end; large enough to do a big job. But it does this at the cost of a larger distance. You must therefore push on the one end of the lever for a longer time than you would have to without the lever.

According to the work energy theorem, the amount of work you do on a system becomes the energy contained in the system. Because the work is constant with or without the lever, the energy is also constant. A lever therefore does not create energy. The energy inputted to do a certain job is exactly the same with or without the lever. The lever just maximizes efficiency. Human muscles are built for endurance, and not short-term, high-intensity performance. It is easier for humans to carry 10 pounds up 100 steps than to carry 100 pounds up 10 steps, even though the total mechanical energy required for both jobs is exactly the same. Even though the total mechanical energy required is the same, one job is easier because human muscles operate more efficiently at low intensities for a long time. If a person tries to carry 100 pounds up 10 steps, he would waste a lot of energy that would end up as heat because of the inefficiency of human muscle for such a task. The person in this case would have to expend more total energy to get the job done: the energy to lift the 100 pounds up the 10 steps + all the energy that gets wasted to heat because of the muscle's inefficiency in this performance mode.

";All simple machines â€“ levers, pulleys, ramps, screws, gears, etc â€“ operate on this same principle. They increase efficiency by allowing a high-force/small-distance job to be accomplished by humans who operate best in low-force/large-distance mode. But the total work and total energy expended for a given job is always they same, no matter what machine you use.;toy,sister,rapidly,difficulty,exist
Edexcel;AS;2281 - Economics,;2014;Jan Feb;"How do projectors project the color black?
";Projectors do not project the color black. This makes sense since black is really the absence of light, and you can't project something that does not exist. When a projector sends a beam of light on to a wall or a projector screen so that an image is formed on the wall or screen, the parts of the image that look black are really a very dim white color (which we sometimes call gray). The projector sends some light to all parts of the image, including the parts that we perceive as black. Some white light is indeed beamed to the parts of the image that are supposed to be black, but the light is typically dim enough in these regions that they look black to our eyes when surrounded by areas of the image that are receiving much more light and therefore are much brighter.;"On the left is an illustration of what a black-and-white checkerboard image would look like projected on the wall if a projector could literally project black. Note that the dark regions in the projected image would be darker than the regions of the wall outside of the projected image. Since black is actually just the absence of light and not something that can literally be projected, the illustration on the right shows what we actually see. Regions of the projected image that are supposed to be black are actually a dim white color, which our brains interpret as black if the image contrast is high enough. Note that the ""black"" squares in the checkerboard on the right are actually brighter than the regions of the wall outside of the projected image. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
Our human eyes and brains are designed to evaluate a color based on how it looks relative to the colors of the surrounding objects, rather than based on the absolute spectral content of the color. For instance, look at the image below. Directly surrounding both black dots are patches of blue that are the exact same color. They look different to humans because of the way our brains perceive color based on the color of surrounding areas. You can convince yourself that the areas right around the two black dots are the same color blue by holding a thick piece of paper up to this image with two holes cut out right over the black dots, allowing you to see the colors directly around the dots without seeing the rest of the image.

shadow on checkerboard showing relative color perception
The blue colors immediately surrounding both black dots are the exact same color. They look like different colors because of the way our brains perceive color based on the color of surrounding areas. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
The tendency of our brains and eyes to evaluate a color based on its relation to nearby colors is actually beneficial. Consider a standard yellow banana. A ripe banana placed next to an unripe banana is always more yellow and less green than the unripe banana, no matter what type of light is shining on it. The relative color difference between the two bananas does not change, even if the light source does change. In contrast, the absolute color of the bananas does change as the light source changes. For instance, objects that are in shade on a sunny day are more blue than objects in direct sunlight, because they are being illuminated by the whitish blue sky rather than the white sunlight. Therefore, a ripe banana sitting in direct sunlight has an absolute color of yellow, while the same ripe banana has an absolute color of yellowish green when in the shade on a clear sunny day. If humans were only able to evaluate colors according to their absolute spectral content, then we would bizarrely conclude that ripe bananas become unripe every time they go in the shade. By basing our color perception on relative color differences rather than absolutes, our brains are able to link object color to intrinsic properties of the object (such as ripeness), rather than assume that object color only tells us the color content of the light source.

Returning to the case of the image cast on the wall by the projector, in order for our brains to perceive a part of the image as black, it just has to be less bright than all the other parts of the image. In this way, a projector can throw some white light on a wall and convince you that it is black. There are a few ways that you can convince yourself of this concept. First of all, turn off the room lights, turn on the projector, and then send an image from your computer to the projector that is completely black everywhere. Look closely and you will see that the area of the wall on which the projector is projecting is brighter than an area of the same wall that is out of the projector's reach, despite the fact that the projector is supposed to be projecting perfect blackness. Now turn off the projector. You will notice that the wall darkens when the projector turns off, because it has stopped sending the dim white light that is supposed to represent the black colors in the image.";As another way to convince yourself of this, turn the projector on and have it display an image that has black and white regions. Now turn on and off the room lights. You will notice that when the room lights are on, the black regions in the image no longer look very black. They still look black in comparison to the other parts of the image, but they look like a washed-out, muted black color. This is because our color perception depends on relative color differences. When you turn on the room lights, you flood both the black and white regions of the projected image with white light, thereby decreasing the contrast between dark and light in the image. This decreases your eyes' ability to use relative color differences to perceive a dim white color as a black color. For this reason, a projected image is most vivid and convincing when the image has a high contrast between the brightness of its white regions and the darkness of its black regions. High contrast is achieved by building a projector that can send out a lot of light to some regions and send out very little light to other regions. High contrast is also achieved by simply turning off the room lights and shuttering the windows. The fact that we watch projected movies in darkened rooms is direct evidence that projectors can't emit literal black, but instead emit dim white light which is interpreted as black when the contrast is high enough.;copper,ought,west,parallel,badly
Edexcel;AS;5070 - Chemistry;2005;Oct Nov;"How do scientists cool objects to absolute zero?
";Nothing can be cooled to a temperature of exactly absolute zero. The temperature of an object is a measure of the average random motion energy (kinetic energy) of its atoms. Absolute zero is the temperature at which all of an object's atoms have been brought to a dead stop relative to each other. This temperature is denoted by the number zero on absolute temperature scales such as Kelvin. Absolute zero is more of a fundamental limit than a reachable temperature.;Absolute zero can never be perfectly reached because of quantum fluctuations. Perfectly stopping every atom at a distinct point would require fixing the exact location and momentum of the atom, which is not physically possible according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Every quantum system has a non-zero ground state energy which is the lowest possible state. This is nature's way of enforcing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Additionally, thermodynamics states that perfectly cooling an object to absolute zero would require an infinite number of steps. Despite the inaccessibility of a temperature at exactly absolute zero, scientists have been able to get very close. The Low Temperature Laboratory at Aalto University cooled a piece of rhodium metal to 0.0000000001 K using a nuclear demagnetization refrigerator. A nuclear demagnetization refrigerator cools a material by aligning the spin of nuclei using a strong magnetic field.;;tight,pay,furniture,subject,citizen
Cambridge;O;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2008;Oct Nov;"How do tractor beams work?
";"Up until recently, tractor beams (beams of light that tow objects) existed only in the world of science fiction. While large-scale tractor beams that can tow space ships are still machines of the future, microscopic tractor beams are here today. The idea at first seams to defy physics. Shoot light at an object and the light's momentum should push the object away from the light source according to the law of conservation of momentum; not pull it closer like a tractor dragging its cargo. But what if you managed to create a situation where upon striking the object, the light gains forward momentum instead of losing it.";In that case, the law of conservation of momentum tells us that the object will lose momentum in the forward direction, even to the point of going backwards, towards the light source. So there is a way to make a tractor beam without violating any physics, if you can get the light to gain forward momentum upon interacting with the object. You need to the light to slingshot past the object instead of bouncing off of it. The most effective method to accomplish this feat at this point in time is to use solenoidal light beams. A solenoidal shape is like a wire wrapped in circles into a helix that forms a hollow cylinder. But in this case, there are no wires. The light itself, traveling through the air, is formed into this hollow, spiraling shape. San-Hyuk Lee of UC Berkeley and his collaborators have experimentally verified that the solenoidal light shape indeed draws objects â€“ in their case, microscopic glass spheres â€“ towards the light source. They have therefore successfully created a real tractor beam. You can think of the spiral-shaped light beam as a screw that twists the object up the beam.;Only microscopic objects have been tractor-beamed so far because light carries so little momentum. In order to tow large objects, you would need very strong light beams. So strong, in fact, that damage of the object may become a problem. Research is ongoing.;man,actual,happily,were,exist
Edexcel;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2001;Aug Sep;"How do you focus regular light to make it a laser beam?
";"A laser beam is not just focused light. A laser beam is coherent light. Furthermore, you can't create a laser beam by cleverly focusing regular light, no matter how hard you try. You create a laser beam using stimulated emission. Stimulated emission is what causes the light in a laser beam to be coherent, and coherence is what makes a laser beam so much more useful than regular light. In fact, the word ""laser"" is actually an acronym that stands for ""Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation""";"What is coherence? In the simplest picture, you can visualize a beam of light as a bundle of many little sine waves traveling through space. In this picture, coherence means that all the respective peaks of the various sine waves are lined up in space, and continue to stay lined up as the waves travel. By the phrase ""lined up"", we mean that if you were able to take a snapshot at a certain time of the different wave components in a light beam, you would find that all the first peaks are at the same location in space, all the second peaks are at the same distance, etc. In order for the peaks to stay completely aligned everywhere, a few things have to happen:

1. The waves have to have approximately the same wavelength (temporal coherence)
If one wave has its consecutive peaks separated by a distance of 600 nanometers, and another wave has its peaks separated by a distance of 830 nanometers, then it should be obvious that if you line up one pair of peaks, you cannot line up any of the other pairs of peaks. Ideally, if all the wave components had exactly the same wavelength (and the other criteria listed below were met), then all the peaks could be lined up perfectly, forever. Such a situation is actually physically impossible. It would take an infinitely long beam of light in order to have all the wave components have exactly the same wavelength (the proof of this statement is not obvious and requires Fourier analysis). Despite the fact that an exactly single-wavelength beam of light is physically impossible, we can get very, very close. In fact, having a light beam that is very close to single-wavelength (called ""monochromatic"") is one of the main reason lasers are so useful. Using monochromatic light can allow us to measure or trigger a very specific response in a material (e.g. spectroscopy, laser cooling).

2. The waves have to be in phase (spectral coherence)
The phase of a wave describes what part of a sine wave's cycle exists at a certain reference point. Two waves that are 180Â° out of phase will have one wave peaking at the same point in space that the other wave is bottoming out. Therefore, even if two waves have the same wavelength, if one wave is shifted forward a bit relative to the other wave, their peaks will not be aligned. The phase of the various waves in a beam must be the same in order for their peaks to be aligned and for the beam to be spectrally coherent. The stable phase of a coherent beam can be very useful. The phase of a wave tends to shift when it interacts with a material, so using a beam with a stable phase allows us to measure the phase shift due to the material, and therefore learn something about the material (e.g. ellipsometry).

3. The waves have to be locally traveling in the same direction (spatial coherence)
If you take one wave traveling north and another wave traveling north-east, then their peaks can not be lined up. Only if a beam has its waves at each point traveling in the same direction can the peaks line up. Note that some people restate this principle as ""all the rays of light are parallel"". Such a statement is over-simplified to the point of being wrong. If a coherent beam of light such as a laser beam consisted of completely parallel beams, then such beams would not spread out as they travel. In reality, beams always spread away from straight line motion as they travel through space (we call it ""diffraction""). You may not notice the divergence of a laser beam with your naked eye, but it is there. Rather than saying all the rays of light in a coherent beam are parallel, a more accurate statement would be that the wave components at a certain point in space are parallel in a single coherent beam, but are not parallel from point to point. Also, if two waves are traveling in different directions, but otherwise meet all the other criteria for being jointly coherent, we treat the two waves as completely separate beams, and their combination leads to interference patterns. For a coherent beam that has a very large beam-width compared to its wavelength, the diffraction is very small, so that all of the waves at different locations are very close to parallel. Such beams can be useful for pointing or scanning (e.g. laser printing, 3D laser scanning, bar code scanning, laser guidance of missiles, lidar).

4. The waves have to be the same polarization (polarization coherence)
The polarization of a light wave describes the direction in space that its electric field is oscillating. If one wave has its electric field oscillating up and down, and another wave has its electric field oscillating side to side, then their peaks cannot be lined up because the peaks exist in different directions. The different wave components in a light beam have to have their electric fields pointing in the same direction in order to have their peaks line up and for the beam to be coherent. Polarized light is useful because we can learn something about an object that the light hits by the way the object changes the polarization of the light (e.g. polarimetry).

If all the above criteria are met, then the peaks are all aligned everywhere and they stay aligned as time progresses. The beam is therefore completely coherent. (Note that perfect coherence is physically impossible, but many beams such as laser beams can come very close to being perfectly coherent). Regular light, such as from an incandescent light bulb or from a fire, is incoherent. The light from a fire contains different light waves that are not the same frequency, are not in phase, are not traveling in the same direction, and are not in the same polarization state. Focusing incoherent light, such as by using a glass lens, does not make the light waves have the same frequency, the same phase, the same local direction, or the same polarization. Therefore, focusing incoherent light does not make it coherent like a laser beam. Focusing light just concentrates the energy of the light into a smaller area.

The phenomenon of stimulated emission in a laser is very useful because it produces light that is usually temporally, spectrally, spatially, and polarizationally coherent. Stimulated emission means that an electron is in an excited state when a bit of light (a photon) comes along and knocks the electron down to the unexcited state, causing it to emit another bit of light (another photon) in the process. In the act of knocking the electron down, the original photon causes the new photon to be coherent with it. The process repeats in domino fashion; each time a new photon being added to the beam that is coherent with the original photons. Stimulated emission is not as exotic as it may sound and in fact happens a lit bit all the time. The hard part in designing a working laser is getting stimulated emission to be the main way an electron de-excites. In a regular chunk of matter, an excited electron most often de-excites by colliding with other electrons or atoms, thereby loosing its energy to heat, or by spontaneously emitting a bit of non-coherent light. Designing a laser therefore involves making the stimulated emission transition of the excited electron very probable, and making the other transition possibilities less probable.

Note that stimulated emission is not the only way to make coherent beams. For high frequency waves such as visible light, stimulated emission is the most effective way of creating coherent beams. But for low frequency waves such as radio waves, coherent beams are much easier to create simply by driving a sine-wave electrical current into an antenna. The waves that are created by an antenna that is driven at a single frequency, such as those that carry radio station broadcasts, are coherent. Such broadcast radio waves are technically not laser beams, because they are not created by stimulated emission, but they have all the useful coherence properties of laser beams. A police officer's radar speed gun is a lot more similar to a presentation laser pointer than most people realize. Both are handheld devices that shoot out a beam of coherent electromagnetic waves. Neither one uses focusing to create the beam's coherence.";"1Note: I personally find the word ""amplified"" in the name ""Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"" to be redundant. Stimulated emission is, by definition, an amplification process. Much more important is the fact that stimulated emission leads to coherence. A more accurate name for a laser would be ""Light Coherence by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"". But I guess the acronym ""lcser"" does not roll off the tongue as well as the acronym ""laser"".";congress,subject,giving,he,laid
Cambridge;A;2210 - Computer Science;2011;May Jun;"How do you make a one-photon-thick beam of light?
";There is no such thing as a one-photon-thick beam of light. Photons are not solid little balls that can be lined up in a perfectly straight beam that is one photon wide. Instead, photons are quantum objects. As such, photons act somewhat like waves and somewhat like particles at the same time.;"When traveling through free space, photons act mostly like waves. Waves can take on a variety of beam widths. But they cannot be infinitely narrow since waves are, by definition, extended objects. The more you try to narrow down the beam width of a wave, the more it will tend to spread out as it travels due to diffraction. This is true of water waves, sound waves, and light waves. The degree to which a light beam diffracts and diverges depends on the wavelength of the light. Light beams with larger wavelengths diverge more strongly than light beams with smaller wavelengths, all else being equal. As a result, smaller-wavelength beams can be made much narrower than larger-wavelength beams. The narrowness of a light beam therefore is ultimately limited by wave diffraction, which depends on wavelength, and not by a physical width of photon particles. The way to get the narrowest beam of light possible is by using the smallest wavelength available to you and focusing the beam, and not by lining up photons (which doesn't really make sense in the first place).

Furthermore, photons are bosons, meaning that many photons can overlap in the exact same quantum state. Millions of photons can all exist at the same location in space, going the same direction, with the same polarization, the same frequency, etc. In this additional way, the notion of a ""one-photon-thick"" beam of light does not really make any sense. Coherent beams such as laser beams and radar beams are composed of many photons all in the same state. The number of photons in a light beam is more an indication of the beam's brightness than of the beam's width. It does make sense to talk about a beam with a brightness of 1 photon per second. This statement means that a sensor receives one photon of energy from the light beam every second (which is a very faint beam of light, but is encountered in astronomy).";"Furthermore, we could construct a light source that only emits one photon of light every second. But we discover that as soon as the photon travels out into free space, the single photon spreads out into a wave that has a non-zero width and acts just like a coherent beam containing trillions of photons. Therefore, even if a beam has a brightness of only one photon per second, it still travels and spreads out through space like any other light beam.

Edexcel;AS;7094 - Bangladesh Studies;2021;Jan Feb;How does a microwave oven heat up food even though it emits no thermal radiation?;"A microwave oven does emit thermal radiation to heat up food. Microwave radiation is thermal radiation. For some reason, pre-college teachers and books have a mistaken notion that thermal radiation = infrared radiation. All frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum carry energy, from radio waves, microwaves, infrared waves, visible light, ultraviolet, and X-rays to gamma rays. All frequencies of radiation heat up an object that they strike and therefore can be thermal radiation. When physicists use the term ""thermal radiation"", they either mean radiation that has the ability to heat up an object it strikes.";"Or they mean a broad spectrum of frequencies with a certain shape that depends on the emitter's temperature.

thermal spectrum at 2000 K
This plot shows the frequency spectrum of the thermal radiation that is emitted by a blackbody object that is at a temperature of 2000 K. Even though most of the thermal radiation is in the infrared band of frequencies, some of the thermal radiation takes the form of microwaves, visible light, and ultraviolet. Note that both the frequency axis and the power axis are plotted on logarithmic scales to make the curve easier to analyze. Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird.
The higher the temperature of a glowing body, the more the peak in the spectrum of its emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies. Thus by looking at the relative strength of different frequencies in starlight, astronomers can determine the star's temperature. The word ""thermal"" in this way means that the radiation's spectral shape is linked to the source's temperature. In contrast, ""non-thermal radiation"" means light that is not correlated to the source's temperature. For instance, lasers emit light through a mechanism that is different from that of a hot filament. The laser light is therefore independent of the laser's temperature and is thus non-thermal radiation. But laser light still carries energy and is still able to heat up objects that it strikes. If you take ""thermal radiation"" to mean radiation that carries energy and heats things up, as many pre-college teachers do, then all radiation is thermal, independent of frequency or spectral shape. A microwave oven's radiation heats up soup in the exact same way that a campfire's radiation heats up campers: through electromagnetic radiation.";The misunderstanding that only infrared radiation is thermal perhaps comes from the fact that living human bodies are at a temperature where their thermal radiation peaks in the infrared. If a soldier wants to see human bodies at night, he uses infrared goggles. But the sun's thermal radiation peaks in the visible light frequency band, and its radiation is every bit as thermal. In fact, most of the infrared portion of sunlight is absorbed by the atmosphere and does not make it to us on the surface. Sunlight has no problem heating us up, and its spectral shape is linked to the sun's temperature, despite containing very little infrared radiation.;town,acres,hot,bring,again
Edexcel;A;5054 - Physics;2010;Jan Feb;"How does a penny left on the track derail a train?
";A penny left on a track does not typically derail a train. A train speeding along its track is a very heavy object with an immense amount of momentum. The penny is simply too light to do much of anything.;"It is flattened or knocked out of the way by the train. The basic principle at work is the conservation of momentum. Objects with low momentum (light objects going slow) cannot do much to heavier objects because they have little momentum to give to the other object. This is why specks of dust don't knock over motorcycles, ducks don't capsize cruise liners, and mosquitoes don't detour trucks. Flattening pennies using trains is still dangerous though; to the people placing the pennies. A search of newspapers reveals several cases of pennies failing to derail trains but succeeding in getting the penny placers killed in the process. Trains aren't invincible though. A car, truck, or even a brick left on the track can lead to derailment. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, 1.4% of train derailments from 2009-2012 were caused by objects on the track. ";This group of causes includes snow, ice, and coal. The vast majority of derailments are caused by railroad equipment failure. For your own safety and the safety of the train, never place anything on the tracks.;nuts,parallel,natural,gently,ice
Edexcel;AS;7010 - Computer Studies;2008;Jan Feb;"How does a photon accelerate to light speed so quickly?
";A photon of light does not accelerate to light speed. Rather, a photon is already traveling at light speed c when it is created. It's not like a photon jumps from a speed of zero to light speed instantaneously. Rather, a photon is always traveling at c, from the moment of its creation.;"If you think of a photon as a solid ball, then you are justified in finding it absurd that it could already be going at a high speed the moment it is created. For example, before a mud ball can whirl through the air, you have to form the ball from a mud puddle and then throw it to get it up to speed.

The key is that a photon is not a traditional particle. Rather it is a quantum object, which is part wave, and part particle. When a photon is being created, it is acting mostly like a wave, and waves have no problem going a certain speed from the moment they are created. For instance, bob your hand up and down against a pond's still surface and you will create water waves that ripple away from your hand. The water waves do not start out motionless and then slowly pick up speed as they travel away. The water waves are already traveling at their nominal speed the moment you start creating them. That is how waves behave.

Waves are created because a deformation in the material medium or in the field medium causes the medium to snap back towards the equilibrium state, but overshoot this state, and therefore end up oscillating back and forth, all the while yanking neighboring regions into the same motion. The wave speed is therefore determined by the medium's ability to snap back, and not by an external agent pushing the wave to accelerate it to different speeds. Pushing harder on the medium just makes the crests of the waves taller. It does not make the wave travel faster through space. If the medium is constant across a region of space and across all frequencies of motion, then the wave speed will be constant through this region. In a region of uniform medium, a wave cannot accelerate. Therefore if a wave is created in such a region, it must be created right at the wave speed of that region.

This is not just a quantum concept. It applies to all waves, from seismic waves, ocean waves, and sound waves, to waves on a piano string. Some people say that the reason a photon travels at light speed the moment it is created is because it is a massless particle, and therefore must always travel at the speed of light. While it is true that the photon is massless and therefore always travels at c in all reference frames, this is not the reason that it is created already having a speed. The reason is simply because it is a wave. Other quantum objects such as the electron do have mass, and they have no problem being created at some non-zero speed without ever needing to be accelerated to this speed.";All quantum objects are partly waves and therefore can have a speed the moment they are created. For example, a free neutron eventually decays to a proton and creates an electron and an anti-neutrino in the process. This decay has been observed experimentally many times. The electron that is created in this process zips off at a certain speed that it has the moment it is created, without ever being accelerated. The electron can do this, even though it has mass, because it has wave-like properties.;ranch,man,from,syllable,composition
Cambridge;O;7707 - Accounting;2008;May Jun;"How does quantum theory allow a rock to turn suddenly into a duck?
";Quantum theory does not allow a rock to turn suddenly into a duck. It does not allow any other bizarre transformation to happen either. This idea is a myth perpetuated by people who misunderstand quantum theory. Foundational to quantum theory is the concept of particle uncertainty. It is impossible to know a particle's exact location and exact momentum at the same time. Furthermore, a quantum particle's exact location and exact momentum does not even exist at the same time. The uncertainty in quantum theory is not a result of measurement limitations but is inherent to each quantum object itself.;"The more you try to trap a single electron and therefore force it to have a more defined position, the less defined becomes its momentum. This uncertainty means that quantum particles can end up in unexpected places. The more unexpected its destination, the less likely it is to end up there, but the probability is never zero.

The line or reasoning goes that because a rock is made out of quantum particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons), and because quantum particles can do unexpected things on account of the uncertainty principle, then a rock can do unexpected things like turn suddenly into a duck. According to this line of reasoning, the probability of a rock turning into a duck is very low, so that it almost never happens, but it is physically possible and so it will happen if we wait long enough. This line of reasoning is wrong. It goes wrong in applying the uncertainty principle to large-scale objects. The uncertainty principle applies only to individual quantum objects and small collections of quantum objects. When trillions of quantum objects are involved, the uncertainty goes completely away. The behavior of a trillion atoms is not just the behavior of one atom times a trillion. The reason for this is that the atoms are interacting with each other. As a loose analogy, the behavior of 10 kids at one birthday party is very different from the summed behavior of 10 kids, each alone at 10 different birthday parties. Even the smallest objects visible to human eyes, such as a grain of sand, have trillions upon trillions of atoms. Human-sized objects therefore have no uncertainty and will never do anything bizarre no matter how long you wait. Quantum theory is fundamentally statistical. This means that there is always uncertainty for a single particle, but for a statistically-significant collection of particles, the system predictably obeys the equations of quantum theory.";Quantum uncertainty is not a magic ticket that allows you to break all other laws of physics. The conservation laws are fundamental, universal laws of physics that hold everywhere and cannot be broken. The conservation of mass/energy states that matter/energy cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed from one state into another. The conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system is constant. Momentum can not be created or destroyed. If a tiny pebble suddenly transformed into a large duck, it would definitely break the law of conservation of mass/energy as matter would have been created out of nothing. If a rock sitting motionless suddenly shot in the air with no external force applied, it would break the law of conservation of momentum as momentum would have been created out of nothing. The conservation laws of physics and the statistical nature of quantum theory keep the universe ticking forward in a very predictable way despite the uncertainty present in single particles. A rock will never turn into a duck no matter how long you wait.;glass,from,song,knife,familiar
Edexcel;AS;5014 - Environmental Management;2021;Oct Nov;"How does sound going slower in water make it hard to talk to someone underwater?
";Sound travels faster in water than in air. The speed of sound in air under typical conditions is about 343 meters per second, while the speed of sound in water is about 1,480 meters per second. Fundamentally, standard sound is a compression wave traveling though a material. You can think of a material as a grid of heavy balls (representing the atoms) connected by springs (representing the bonds between the atoms).;"When you push on a few balls in the grid, they move closer to their neighbors on one side and the springs connecting the balls and their neighbors compress. But the compressed springs bounce back, replacing the balls to their original position. In the process, however, the neighboring balls get pushed, causing the springs connecting them and their neighbors to compress. This process repeats in domino fashion and you get a compression wave traveling though the grid of balls. In a similar way, standard sound is just a compression wave traveling through the atoms and bonds in a material.

With the compression-wave nature of sound in mind, it should make sense that stiffer materials propagate sound at higher speeds. In the metaphorical grid of balls and springs, stiffer springs will snap back faster, leading to faster wave propagation. Similarly, in real materials, stiffer chemical bonds between atoms leads to a faster speed of sound. Non-stiff materials such as air and water have relatively slow speeds of sound, while stiff materials such as diamond and iron have high speeds of sound. The key component is the stiffness of the chemical bonds involved and not just the type of molecules that are present. For instance, water molecules bound in ice form have a speed of sound more than twice as fast as in liquid water.

However, we have to take into account more than the chemical bonds (the springs). We also have to take into account the atoms themselves (the metaphorical balls in the grid). More massive balls have more inertia to overcome and therefore take longer to respond to a push from a neighbor. In general, heavier materials (those with higher mass densities) have slower speeds of sound, all else being equal. In determining the speed of sound in a given material, the material's stiffness and density tend to work against each other. While solids usually have a higher speed of sound than liquids because solids are stiffer than liquids, this generalization is not always true because density also plays a role. A light, stiff liquid (such as glycerol with v = 1900 m/s) can have a higher speed of sound than a heavy, spongy solid (such as rubber with v = 1600 m/s). While water is denser than air, its stiffness is enough greater than air to compensate for the high density and make the speed of sound greater in water.";But the fact that sound travels faster in water than in air just brings up the next question: Why is it harder to talk to someone underwater than in air? The answer is that sound couples poorly from air to water. When you talk, you do so by emitting air and then sending compression waves through this air. Your lungs provide the burst of air, and your vibrating vocal cords and mouth imprint the appropriate sound waveform on the air. In order for someone underwater to hear you, the sound waves have to go from the air in your mouth into the water surrounding you. Sound waves have a hard time going from air into water and mostly get reflected at the air-water interface instead of being transmitted into the water. If your lungs and airways were filled with water, and if your vocal cords and lungs were tuned to handle water, you would do a better job of generating sound underwater as there would no longer be an air-water interface.;its,share,happily,energy,faster

What if you hold your hand out the window of your car on the highway and a bit of loose gravel flings up and hits you on the arm? It would sting, but it wouldn't kill you.

Edexcel;A;7110 - Principles of Accounts;2007;Oct Nov;"How is a magnetic field just an electric field with relativity applied?
";This is a misconception. A magnetic field is not just an electric field with relativity applied, i.e. an electric field viewed from the wrong reference frame. In reality, a magnetic field is a fundamental field which can exist in a certain reference frame without needing any help from an electric field. More generally, both electric fields and magnetic fields are part of one fundamental, unified entity: the electromagnetic field.;"Electric and magnetic fields obey a set of physical laws called Maxwell's equations. Einstein's theory of Special Relativity describes how space and time change depending on the choice of inertial reference frame. It turns out that Special Relativity is automatically contained in Maxwell's equations. In fact, Einstein discovered Special Relativity by closely scrutinizing and understanding Maxwell's equations. Therefore, using Maxwell's equations in relativistic form, we can figure out how to mathematically transform electric and magnetic fields from one reference frame to another. In other words, if I measure and map out the electric and magnetic fields in a room while I am standing motionless on the ground, then by applying the relativistic frame transformations to these field expressions I know what the fields will look like to an observer that is coasting through the room on roller skates. These electromagnetic relativistic frame transformation equations have been experimentally found to be correct.

If you start in a reference frame that has only an electric field and no magnetic field, then when you make a relativistic transformation to a new reference frame, you find that there is both an electric field and a magnetic field present, as observed in this new frame. This fact seems to imply that a magnetic field is only an electric field as viewed from the wrong reference frame. In other words, this fact seems to imply that a magnetic field is really just a non-fundamental relativistic version of the electric field. However, a closer scrutiny of the fields shows this conclusion to be incorrect.

First of all, Special Relativity teaches us that all inertial reference frames are equally valid and equally fundamental. If two marbles roll past each other, then from the red marble's point of view the red marble is motionless and the blue marble is moving. From the blue marble's point of view the blue marble is motionless and the red marble is moving. Both viewpoints are equally correct and equally fundamental. The fact that the two marbles see the situation differently does not indicate that there is a paradox, that physics is broken, or that one viewpoint is ultimately more right than the other. It just means that the situation is being measured in two different reference frames. There are no ""wrong"" reference frames or less-fundamental reference frames in the universe. Therefore, a magnetic field cannot be only an electric field as viewed from the wrong reference frame because there are no wrong reference frames. Since there exists an inertial reference frame in which a magnetic field exists without an electric field being present, and since every inertial frame is real and fundamental, this means that a magnetic field is real, is fundamental, and is not necessarily caused by an electric field.

Secondly, using the electromagnetic relativistic frame transformation equations, you can show that there is no way to start with a purely electric field (no magnetic field present) and transform into a reference frame where there is a purely magnetic field (no electric field present). This means that if a magnetic field were only an electric field as viewed from the wrong reference frame, then purely magnetic fields would not exist. However, purely magnetic fields do exist. Therefore, magnetic fields are more than just relativistic electric fields.

The correct statement is that electric fields and magnetic fields are both fundamental, both are real, and both are part of one unified entity: the electromagnetic field. Depending on what reference frame you are in, a particular electromagnetic field will look more electric and less magnetic, or more magnetic and less electric. However, this does not change the fact that they are both fundamental and both part of the same unified entity. A purely electric field as viewed in one inertial frame is part electric and part magnetic in all other reference frames. Similarly, a purely magnetic field as viewed in one inertial frame is part electric and part magnetic in all other reference frames. The magnetic field is not just a relativistic version of the electric field, and the electric field is not just a relativistic version of the magnetic field. Rather, the unified electromagnetic field is innately and self-consistently relativistic.

Note that for the sake of the discussion, I have ignored quantum effects. The most accurate description of electromagnetic fields is currently not the original Maxwell's equations, but the quantum form of Maxwell's equations, which is called quantum electrodynamics. However, since quantum electrodynamics simply extends Maxwell's equations rather than replaces them, all of the concepts in this article are still valid.";"Also note that I have used the word ""inertial"" a lot in this article. This means that we are only considering reference frames that have a flat spacetime, i.e. reference frames that are not accelerating and do not have large amounts of gravity. In order to describe non-inertial reference frames, you have to use Einstein's theory of General Relativity, which is more complicated than Special Relativity. However, since the conclusion is the same (the electromagnetic field is unified and fundamental), I have described this article in the context of inertial frames for the sake of simplicity.";laid,bridge,freedom,height,shadow
Edexcel;O;5014 - Environmental Management;2011;Aug Sep;How long can you use a cell phone before getting a brain tumor?;"Cell phones do not cause cancer, no matter how long they are used, because they communicate using radio waves. Radio waves simply don't have enough energy per photon to ionize atoms. The World Health Organization states, ""Only the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes X rays and gamma rays, is ionizing"".";"Cancer occurs when the DNA in a cell is altered so that the cell grows in an uncontrolled way. DNA can be altered in many ways, but when it comes to cancer due to radiation exposure, an electron must be knocked off a molecule by a bit of radiation. The smallest possible bit of electromagnetic radiation is known as a photon. Electrons are bound to molecules, so it takes a certain minimum energy to knock off the electron. Light with frequencies above ultraviolet (x-rays and gamma rays) are known as ionizing radiation because each photon has enough energy to knock an electron off a molecule. Photons of light with frequencies at and below ultraviolet (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, red, orange, yellow, blue, violet) are non-ionizing. They simply don't have enough energy to remove an electron and cause cancer.

Increasing the strength of a radio wave will not help it knock off electrons. Increasing the strength of a radio wave simply introduces more photons into the beam. But each radio photon still has the same energy it always does, which is not enough to ionize. When non-ionizing waves flow past a molecule, they shake up the electrons a bit but don't knock them off. This electron shaking leads to heating. A microwave oven heats up your food in the same way a campfire heats up your skin and in the same way a radio wave ever-so-slightly heats up your body. None of them causes cancer, no matter how long you sit there. You may get burned by sticking your hand in the fire or grabbing a hot dish right out of the microwave, but you won't get a tumor.

If a radio wave did cause cancer, then candlelight would cause far more cancer, because visible light has far more energy per photon. In terms of radiation, a candle emits far more energy than a cell phone, and they are both harmless. Infrared waves have more energy per photon than radio waves, and everything with a non-zero temperature emits infrared waves. This means that the infrared waves coming from your chair, your pencil, and your clothes would give you cancer long before radio waves from your cell phone would, but they don't. The world is swamped with natural radio waves and infrared waves. Just ask any infrared camera designer what his main obstacle is in designing a camera and he will tell you his greatest challenge is separating the meaningful waves from all the background waves in the air. Anybody who has struggled with an old-fashioned analog TV antenna in an attempt to get a clear picture can tell you that the natural radio waves in the air can be quite overwhelming compared to the man-made ones.";People who are worried about being bombarded with radio waves in our increasingly wireless world must realize that the sun and the rocks have been bombarding mankind with infrared and radio waves long before radio broadcast stations and WIFI routers came along. There are electromagnetic waves with high enough frequency to damage molecules: x-rays and gamma rays. That's why if you get too many x-ray scans taken you will get cancer. In addition, alpha, beta and neutron radiation can cause cancer, but they are only created by nuclear reactions, and not by cell phones. Any machine that produces x-rays is known to be dangerous and is heavily regulated in order to ensure safe use.;browserling,determine,animal,model,found

Since a mole of atoms contains 6.0221 x 1023 atoms, there are 2.2452 x 1022 zinc atoms and 5.9230 x 1020 copper atoms in a penny, for a total of 2.3044 x 1022 atoms in a penny.

The earth has a surface area of 510,072,000 square kilometers, or 5.10072 x 1032 square nanometers. The surface area of the earth really depends on what you include in your definition of surface. For instance, if we wish to cover the area of every leaf on every tree and shrub with atoms from the penny, then this will change our answer. Surprisingly, it will not change our answer very much. Most of the earth is covered in relativity flat oceans, sandy deserts, snow fields, barren rocks, and meadows. Trees, shrubs, buildings, and other irregularly-shaped objects only cover a very small percentage of the earth (trees and buildings seem common to most of us humans because most of us live near crowded concentrations of trees and/or buildings). At any rate, we must pick some definition of earth's surface area to make any calculations. The number cited above does not include the surface area of tree leaves and other small irregularities. In the context of trying to cover the earth with a flattened penny, you can think of this definition of surface area as us lowering a sheet of zinc so that it drapes along the tops of the trees, but does not wrap around any of the leaves or branches of the trees. The thinnest we could ever hammer a sheet of material is one atom thick. We therefore assume that we are creating a one-atom-thick planar sheet of material. Using the above value for earth's surface area, we divide it by the number of atoms in a penny to find how much area each atom will occupy when the atoms are spread evenly across earth's surface. We get the value of 2.21347 x 1010 square nanometers per atom, or 0.0000343 square inches per atom. This may seem like a small area, but it is huge compared to the types of areas spanned by simple molecules.

From here on out we will assume that all of the atoms in the penny are zinc atoms. This is a good assumption because almost all of the atoms in the penny are zinc atoms (97.5%). Also, in terms of atomic size and bonding distance, zinc and copper are nearly identical. When allowed to bond into a solid piece of material, zinc atoms arrange themselves into stacks of planar hexagonal grids. Therefore, in creating our one-atom thick sheet of zinc, we will arrange our zinc atoms along a planar hexagonal grid. If the penny's atoms are spread out uniformly on a hexagonal grid covering earth's surface, then each atom will have to be 159,870 nanometers away from its next nearest atoms in order to cover the entire earth (for a hexagonal grid of objects, the distance between nearest-neighbor objects is 1.0746 times the square root of the area that each object has to itself). In other words, taking the atoms of a single penny and spreading them out over the entire earth in a hexagonal arrangement will cause each atom to be about 0.16 millimeters away from its neighboring atoms. In order to form a solid chunk of material, atoms have to be close enough to form stable bonds. In regular pieces of zinc metal, stable chemical bonds are formed when each zinc atom is a distance of 0.26649 nanometers away from its next nearest zinc atoms. Therefore, the atoms of our smashed penny will be almost exactly 600,000 times too far apart to maintain stable bonds and constitute a solid piece of metal. With this kind of separation, we don't have a solid penny at all. We have a very dilute zinc gas spread over the earth. These widely separated atoms would blow around, dissolve into the ocean, mix with the clouds, and react with other atoms, so that we no longer have any type of distinct object that we would say is covering the earth. For this reason, you cannot hammer and flatten a penny until it covers the entire. The earth is simply too big and a penny has simply too few atoms to accomplish this task. Even if we break each zinc atom into 30 hydrogen atoms (ignoring all the messy details of the nuclear reactions involved), the atoms are still about a hundred thousand times too far apart to form stable chemical bonds. Besides, hydrogen atoms don't bond to form a solid chunk of material under normal conditions.";These thoughts lead to another question: How much area can a smashed penny cover and still remain a solid chunk of material? To calculate this, we again realize that the thinnest a material can get is one atom thick. Also, the distance that zinc atoms need to be from each other and still stay bonded as a solid is 0.26649 nanometers, as already mentioned. This means that as part of a hexagonal planar arrangement of atoms, each zinc atom needs to occupy 0.0615 square nanometers of area. Multiply this number by the 2.3044 x 1022 atoms in a penny and we get a total area of 1417 square meters, which is about a quarter of the size of an American football field. In other words, if you had a special machine that carefully hammered a penny until it was everywhere just an atom thick, it would only cover a quarter of a football field. Keep in mind that at this thickness, you would be hard pressed to even see the penny and you would rip the penny when walking on it without feeling any resistance (think of walking on aluminum foil, but much, much thinner). To cover the entire earth's surface with one-atom-thick smashed pennies, you would need at least 360 billion pennies.;west,plural,danger,moving,clean
